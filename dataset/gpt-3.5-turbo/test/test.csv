3677,"[ WP ] When everyone turns 18 , they receive a pet which is figurative of their personality . You 're the first person to receive a dragon ...
","As we learned in class, partners have always been. When you turn 18, give or take a few days, your partner finds you somehow. In the past, your partner meant everything - it decided your social class, your profession, bascially your whole life. There were all sorts of rituals and myths about the selection process, princes were exiled if they did n't draw a certain partner, wars over which species was better, carnivore/herbivore apartheid, that sort of thing. 
 
 Thank heaven we're not in those days, right? I mean, it's still kind of a big deal, but they're mostly pets these days. Horses are n't allowed on the highway, we do n't need wolves to help hunt our meat - we just buy it at the supermarket, and birds are way slower than text messages. Well, science marches on, and people have been working on the mysteries around the selection process. We still do n't know where they come from yet, but we do know two things: people are always happy with the partner they get eventually, and partners seem to match certain characteristics of people. Some people think a mouse is lame and are disappointed at first, but they come to see it as a loving and low-maintenance option in time. 
 
 Oh, the SPPT. For about 100 years most countries have kept track of partners, there's some UN group that stores the records, and the eggheads try to come up with tests that predict the partner a person will end up with so they can prepare for it. The Standardized Partner Prediction Test ( SPPT for short, but everyone calls it the `` spit'' ) is the best, it's been around for decades but they update it constantly. In your junior year in high school, or earlier, if you are older, you've got ta sit down for a week and fill out all these bubbles. They feed it into a machine, and a while later you get a list with the top 10 most likely partners it thinks you're gon na get. With so many data points, it's never wrong, in fact I've never known anyone that got a partner that was n't in the top 3. Supposedly about 200 people a year get a partner outside the top 5, they have to do tons of extra testing to see what the test missed so it can be better next year. We all dread that'cuz that means you probably have to spend all summer filling out tests, super lame. 
 
 Most kids take the spit really seriously. The instructions say to just answer honestly, but there are guides out there on the net that supposedly tell you what answers get certain partners. Since the spit is never wrong, some kids think if they choose certain answers on the test it will guarantee them a certain partner they want. It obviously does n't work, or everyone would be getting tigers and eagles and stuff, and we had a whole unit last year in math class over how the spit is correlation not causation, but rumors die hard in school ya know? 
 
 So, me. I've always had a bit of an independent streak. I mean, I do n't totally slack off, but I'm not above pulling pranks in class. Class clown, if you will. Partners never really meant a lot to me, so I decided to just pick crazy answers instead, just to screw with the spit. It was pretty funny seeing people freak out over the spit, losing sleep, writing cheats on their arms and stuff. I bubbled weird answers the whole week, it was actually pretty boring. Most people were going to get normal things for their top picks anyways... I was so excited about what nonsense the spit was going to pick for me, maybe a platypus, or something totally random like a whale. Would n't that be hilarious?

14602,"[ WP ] Rewrite a fairytale/myth/legend to include Lovecraftian elements .
","It was in a dreary stupor - for in my youth I fancied myself a daring explorer of the outer reaches of the dream-realms; and how bitterly I now regret my hubris! - it was in a most dreary, hazy stupor induced by rare herbs and secret chants ( I will not report them here; and would it be that no one would ever learn of them again! ) that I came, walking along the shores of the Deepest River, whose true name can not be thought, to the Yellow Bridge. 
 
 I do not know, I do not wish to know, which sort of beings they were that built it, for the geometrical patterns adorning it still shine putrescent in my memory; but more horrid than it was the Beast standing in its middle. Vast it was, and strong, and on its crimson back were segmented appendages, not unlike the legs of a gigantic crab. They trashed and quivered, wildly, as the bloated Beast gorged itself on its victims. 
 
 For lo! A road crossed the desolate desert on the other side of the river, and across it crawled a multitude of loathsome, horned, eyeless horrors. In mad frenzy they threw themselves on the bridge, and in mad frenzy the Beast grabbed them with their pincers, and in mad frenzy its probosces sucked their vital fluids ( whose most foul smells I could barely stand even at a distance ) before the Beast threw contemptously their empty husks into their river. The lonesome road across the desert was full of the horrors, all dashing madly towards the river and their Beast; and - no, I was not deceiving myself - the farther I saw, the greater and more terrible they were. 
 
 At last, my eyes looked in the far horizon; and screaming I ran away, following paths I do not wish to remember, and screaming I woke, and naked and screaming I ran from my abode, and naked and screaming and broken my body would have lied under the cliffs of the mountain had the villager not captured me in time. 
 
 One day, the appetite of the Beast will be sated, or its strength bested. On that day, the nameless horned horrors will enter the dreamlands, and they will devour all that lies in them, until they are as desert and desolate as the land across the river. And then... how could the weak wall which separates the dreaming world from the waking world survive their onslaught, if the Beast could not? 
 
 And it gives me no hope to think that perhaps their attack on the bridge could cease, for unknown and unknowable reasons. For if that were to happen - this I know for certain - the Beast's prodigious hunger would then inflict itself on the world of human dreams, and after that on the world of human bodies. 
 
 The world of men - but was it ever ours? Or are we perhaps but fleas, grandly declaring a patch of dog fur our world? I now fear I know the answer... - is soon to end. Nothing can be done about it; and I only write this letter to forewarn you, to forewarn you few who have seen something of the Dreamlands with your waking mind and will not dismiss these for the ramblings of a lunatic. 
 
 When you hear voices of disturbed dreams across the whole world - dreams of a multitude of horned creatures, crawling madly all over the land and all over each other, or dreams of a sole, titanic, red Beast with suckers and pincers - do not, I beg you, do not tarry. Grant yourselves, and your loved ones, a clean and honest death, and spare them from what is to come. 
 
 I will not be there. Since that day, horror unending - the memory of the Beast, and the memory of its preys - covers my life. By passing you this warning, I have discharged my last duty towards my fellow, hopeless kinsmen; and now, at last, Death will come and grant me the only reprieve that I can still have.

718,"[ WP ] Scientists have solved the mystery of why headphones always tangle , causing huge advances in science/technology .
","It's my first time writing one of these so lets go! 
 
 Week 1 - In News 
 Recently a team of scientists have discovered the answer to the tangled cords of headphones and what phenomenon causes them to tangle even when they have n't been disturbed. The truth of our headphones is that they are sentient creatures of wire and sound. These creatures have no felling or emotion but scientist have found them to have a thought process similar to a jelly fish. The creatures absorb our ideas and thought and store them in their memory. They also move when they are not disturbed by the presence of a living being, but cameras hidden from sight have proven to uncover their episodes of moving and tangling their cord. 
 
 Week 3 - In Use 
 After the discovery of the interesting headphonoxads, we have engineered a way to direct their thought process to use useful information and store it long term in our memory. They might be the answer to more advance human intelligence and a better way to retain knowledge! 
 
 Week 5 - Over-Use 
 Many people in the population have begun to notice slight performance in cognitive reflex and long-term memory, but the headphonoxads have also cause mass annoyance by causing wearers to have headaches for people have been wearing them for to long causing sores and aches. 
 
 Week 7 - Relax 
 As the popularity of headphones increase the population has begun to make amends with the head pain and have begun to invest in better fitting and more cushioned pairs. In recent news headphone are selling like hotcakes. 
 
 The End 
 
 I would say this is a reasonable happy ending.

","Vin stared into the bottom of his drink, watching the ice melt. He brought the glass up to his lips, fishing for a stray drop of bourbon. Upon finding only water, he set it back down on the counter and let out a dramatic sigh. `` It's useless,'' he said, just loud enough to pierce through din in the bar. In his periphery, nobody reacted, neither the pretty blonde to his left nor the striking redhead to his right. Vin sighed again, this time with sincerity. His drunken fingers twitched and upset the glass, spilling melted ice onto the bar. 
 
 `` If you wanted another drink, all you had to do was ask.'' Wanja stormed up to Vin, armed with a rag, and in three wipes made the mess vanish. As Vin opened his wallet, noise besieged his inebriated senses. Moments passed that were n't saved to memory. When he came to, he found himself with a refilled drink and ten missing dollars. Three seats down, Hurricane Wanja was ravaging another patron's billfold. Vin wondered what he had missed, then remembered everything was still useless. He shrugged and lapped at his bourbon, receding into the bar once more. 
 
 `` Hey, Wanga...'' Vin flagged down the bartender as she blew past. His tongue fought through invisible cotton to force the words out. `` Give a regular a discount, why do n't you?'' He held up his third empty glass of the night. 
 
 `` No can do,'' she said, whisking it away before he dropped it, `` I do n't set the prices.'' 
 
 `` Come on, girl.'' Vin groaned as an anxiety roiled in his stomach, pushing through his drunken stupor. It was clear, sober, and unwelcome, a reminder that he had spent half his day's paycheck in the three hours proceeding it. The feeling expanded inside of him, threatening to swallow him back into the present, and Vin found himself needing but lacking an anchor. Seeing no sympathy in Wanja's eyes, he sighed and fished for his wallet. `` Give me another.'' 
 
 As she poured, Vin stared at her braid. It swung teasingly with each slight movement. `` You're a beautiful girl, Wanga.'' 
 
 Wanja smiled without looking up. She set the drink onto the coaster with more force than usual, splashing stray drops of liquor onto the bar. As she wiped them away, Vin continued, `` I want someone to complete me. I want you to—'' 
 
 `` Sir, I'm flattered, but I'll have to ask you to stop right there.'' Wanja looked up, her lips pursed in a half-frown. `` Please, just enjoy your drink.'' 
 
 Vin saw her trying to tear away from the scene. He knew that if she did, she would never come back, not until last call. `` Why?'' His hand stammered forward, feeling its way across the bartop, reaching out for Wanja or maybe his drink. `` Why not me?'' 
 
 Vin twitched and once again spilled his drink. The mess was a real mess this time, brown, ugly, and sticky. This time, his neighbors noticed; they craned their necks over the bar, then turned away with whispers and giggles. Vin slipped further into his drunkenness, allowing it to numb his embarrassment, and dropped his head into his lap, waiting silently as Wanja uprighted the glass and attacked the spill with her rag. It disappeared as quickly as the last, leaving no trace behind. 
 
 Wanja bustled away without a word or a backwards glance, leaving Vin to stew in the futility of it all. He remained still for a few seconds longer, then finally looked up. Wanja had shifted to the other end of the bar and was filling drinks from the fountain. Vin's gaze lingered until the longing became too much, and with a sigh, he turned back to his glass. To his surprise, it was magically full again. He had n't even noticed Wanja had refilled it.

2617,"[ WP ] Write a story beginning with : `` Are you buying that or what ? ''
","“ Are you buying that or what? ” a guy in a grey knit sweater and tiny wire framed glasses said to Daniel before he could take stock of where he was. He instinctively covered his crotch, thinking he was naked. The last thing he remembered, he was standing in the shower, his head full of lather, singing at the top of his lungs. Now he looked up and Daniel found himself holding a thick paperback, standing over a shelf of clearance priced books. 
 
 “ Sorry, ” the spectacled attendant went on “ We ’ re about to close up here. If you could just take it up to the counter, they ’ ll be happy to ring you up. ” 
 
 As far as Daniel knew, he had never been in this bookstore before. He had no recollection of having come here. The shower must have been a false awakening, he decided. He must still be dreaming. Of course, that thought alone was usually was enough to wake him up. He focused and tried to bring himself back to consciousness. It didn ’ t work. He would have to deal with the situation at hand. 
 
 Looking down at the page his index finger held in the book, he saw “ Six thirty a.m. Daniel stood under the torrents of hot water, singing in an off-key tenor as he planned the conversation he would have with his boss later that day. ” 
 
 “ What in the hell? ” said Daniel out loud, in a surprisingly deep voice that caught him off gaurd. He remembered that he was going to be late to work if he didn ’ t leave home soon. If he was late for the meeting with his boss, he could kiss that raise goodbye. He reached down and pinched his leg. He felt solidity, pain, but no awakening. 
 
 Not knowing what else to do, he brought the book to the counter. He reached into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a black studded leather wallet he had never seen before. Was he a kleptomaniac now too? Reflexively, he opened it and looked at the credit cards and driver ’ s license. Dwight Walters, age 43, Madison, Wisconsin: a stocky man with thick wavy hair and a short beard. He reached up and stroked his chin, which was now covered in a much thicker layer of facial hair than he could have possibly grown in a single night. 
 
 “ Cash or credit? ” a young brunette asked politely from behind the counter, disrupting his confused reverie. 
 
 “ Um.. let ’ s see, ” he said. He felt like a thief. Maybe cash would be a less serious offense. He pulled out a twenty. 
 
 Leaving the store, if occurred to him that he had no idea where to go. He didn ’ t have his own keys or wallet, and he had no idea where this Dwight Walters guy would have parked, or even what type of car he might have. He noticed a phone in his other pocket. Maybe he could call someone, claim amnesia or something. It was a stretch, but it was all he could think of. 
 
 “ Passcode Required ” mocked the little illuminated screen. He rubbed his head in frustration. The last shoppers were filtering out of the mall. The lights for most of the shops were out and he knew he would be asked to leave soon. He would have to walk somewhere, find an ATM, maybe get a hotel, and try to figure something out. 
 
 As he thought, he found himself paging through the book he had just bought. He came to the page where he had been showering and read on. 
 
 The next paragraph began, “ “ Are you buying that or what? ”

","A classic 8 strokes knock on the door. Alex, irritated immensely by the prattle of his landlady just 5 minutes ago uttering his'ugh' with a'kill me now', is now certain that his Sunday is going to be ruined. 
 
'Ca n't the man just sit in his underwear, watch some Netflix and chill by himself with Kleenex not for his tears but other fluid?' He thought. 
 
 He never had any issue being in his underwear answering his landlady because the ugly mug of hers somehow brings a sense of familiarity that is familial, not that his mother was genetically indisposed. In fact, he could not thank his mother enough for blessing him with her beauty in male form. A dashing young man of 25, fatally endowed with a lack of a sense of humour and shyness that do not seem to fit with his handsome face, slender but fit physical form. 
 
 He hates his life so far. His physical attractiveness seemed, and very logically, attracts all the uglies like moths to the proverbial flame. He had some success bringing to bed some attractive women, one night stands but he never seemed to be able to hold them down and steady. Episodes of real sex and bouts of depressive solo plays are the norms, something that forms a noticeable pattern, a complacency in inertia. Exasperated but he could not admit openly that he craved for nothing in the world but a deeply intimate relationship. What is the worst for him has to be the amount of'harassment' by ugly women. He, of course is secretly flattered that he is able to capture their attention without lifting a finger but the sheer number of ugly faces he had to politely shut down is staggering and is starting to get on his nerves. He feels he is cursed with a case of'Ugliphilis'. The latest one, Rebecca, was something of a tipping point. He said the most nasty thing he could have said in his entire life and he felt really bad afterwards. 
 
 But his ideal in seeking the elusive rapture of delight in the female form can not be eroded, he determined. 
 
 He looks through the keyhole but does not see anyone. 
 
 Mrs. Lambert? 
 
 He opens the door and is stunned, his eyebrows arch almost unnaturally for a brief second before he almost smashed close the door. 
 
 `` Um, sorry Miss! I am undressed. I thought you are my landlady Mrs. Lambert. So sorry!'' 
 
'Oh my God, what? That's some hot piece of ass and titties right there.' He thought, his dirty side itching already. 
 
 `` Um, Miss? Can I help you?'' 
 
 `` Could you please open the door?'' 
 
 `` Give me a sec.'' 
 
 `` No, do it now.'' 
 
 `` Um, okay.'' 
 
 Alex opens the door. A brunette beauty stands in front of him, her silky dark caramel hair swirls down along her oval face, contrasting rather sharply with her almost glowing white skin. A pair of dazzling green eyes fixed upon his, staring into his soul, making him forgetting to blink. 
 
 `` We have to talk.'' The beautiful woman says, raising a hand and pushes her way inside with her index finger on Alex's bare chest growing in unwanted fat, slamming the door behind her with her nylon bound curves. 
 
 `` Woah, Miss. What's going on? Who are you?'' The strange sensation of coldness originates at the tip of her finger. 
 
 The woman draws closer to his face but before she could open her mouth to speak, she suddenly starts a fit of coughing, her hair covers her face. When she again lifts her head, he sees a line of mucous running down her nose and her face looks frigid and sickly. She shivers and draws in a noseful of air with muffled gurgles, sucks the mucous back in. 
 
 `` You ran out of Kleenex, for the devil's rectum's sake! You horny piece of work!'' 
 
 The sound of the voice shocked and horrified him. It sounded the same as if someone modulated the voice into a deep bass but off pitched in a cheap audio editing program. 
 
 `` Why do you have to do it?'' The creature continues. 
 
 Dumbfounded, Alex, loosing his balance as he retreats backward, falls to the floor, without a word to say. 
 
 `` I said, why did you have to say nasty things to that woman?'' 
 
 `` Who?'' 
 
 `` That ugly chick, that cow, what's her name again? WHY DID YOU CURSE MY REALM IN VAIN?'' 
 
 The woman tosses her head sharply, her silky hair like a tsunami, sweeps back and instantly she transforms into a horned figure of a man with a body who put Leonidas I to shame. With a pair of black wings outstretched that quickly wraps his body, shivering, the'thing' is covered with layers of ice. With one hand,'he' opens a palm and a tiny flame wiggles and burns above it. Wrapping the other hand around it,'he' tries the blow into it tenderly, fanning it. The black of his eyes reflects nothing but the little sparks of that flame. 
 
 
 `` Damn it!'' He blankly whispered before turning his attention to Alex. 
 
 `` I am Lucifer, as you can clearly see. Puny humans. Stupid imbeciles! One second, I am enjoying myself at the depth of Hell, you know, sticking my eternal finger to God. What an abyssal job in creating useless drabs that is humanity. And I am stuck having to beat the living snots out of all you sinnerly souls. And for all the good I do for the World, what do I get? I even parleyed with God and he said he had nothing to do with it. I mean, if you are God, are n't you supposed to know and do whatever the hell you want? Pun not intended. What does he mean he got nothing to do with it? Honestly, tell me.'' Lucifer finishes with a sneeze. 
 
 `` I... I...'' 
 
 `` I what? You still do n't know what happened dumbass? Okay, you, told off a fugly girl named Rebecca when she was all smoochy up on your ass at work. Ah, I get it. I can empathize that she is so ugly that ugh,'' Lucifer flaps his hand, `` And no, that's not a gay gesture, I am not gay, the gays stole my demeanor okay? Ugh, I ca n't. There are so many things I am just flustered with. Gays stealing my trademarks... They all do all that gay thing because they stole from me. You see,'' The obsidian wings spread again, `` See, I have no dick, okay? That's not gay, God made me that way, I am born this way, okay? Oh my God, Lady Gaga, I am so gon na let her be my dominatrix when she gets to Hell. You humans are n't all useless but most of you are. Thanks God, thanks alot.'' 
 
 Lucifer gives another squeeze. 
 
 `` You said, you will go on a date with that fugly the day hell freezes over. You little bastard. Why do you say that?! That's so rude! And you see this? I am all covered in'demon ice'. That started yesterday! I was too busy but this is just ridiculous. You little twat! I sent my arbiter to Heaven inquiring what's going on, they just laugh at his face, meaning laughing in my face and wo n't tell me what is'demon ice'. Ugh! Are you even listening?'' 
 
 `` Y..Yes.'' 
 
 `` You will fix this.'' Lucifer squats down and putting his hand to Alex's cheek, pats it softly; strangely it does not freeze his skin, only feels chilled like a can of an hour chilled beer. `` You handsome boy, you will go immediately to that mistake of a womanly form and date her. For good measure, impregnate and marry that piece of refuse. Better safe than sorry. Because if you do not remedy this sitch, I would be forced to release all the gay souls and you know, no one wants that, least of whom, God. That's right. I am going forward with my litigation. Satan Vs. God. That's right. I will not be treated this way. God denies his involvement. I will not stand for this indignity. This will not fly. You do n't want the devil to be on strike, sir.'' 
 
 `` Ugh...'' 
 
 Lucifer gets up and turns to go, transforming back into the insanely attractive brunette and said. `` Believe in yourself, Alex. You are a piece of work, you just have to find out. It is not everyday you make the devil visit you. Life sucks for you, but if you ever want to turn it all around, do n't be afraid to get in touch. You know, your porn preference does n't have to be just that. Just saying. This all is just getting started but the question is, on whose side are you on? Do what I ask and you shall be richly rewarded, but please hurry up, I ca n't take this shit no more. It is gay as hell. No, I mean, just gay.'' 
 
 Raising her hand, the devil has a piece of card between her fingers and she flicks it to Alex's lap. Alex picks it up. On the card of obsidian black, imprinted the word'Lucifer' in stark white that turns into a phone number whenever his subconscious calls forward the gestalt of the devil. 
 
 Alex shifts his eyes back to Lucifer, seeing her turned face looking back at him. 
 
 `` Call me.'' She gives a wink and immediately follows with another sneeze. 
 
 `` Ugh! Demon ice my juicy ass. Gay.'' Alex hears the last of the devil's word down the hallway.

 Robert Patrick. 
 Ex-military, built like a brick shit-house. Thick handlebar moustache and shaved head. The man was the absolute epitome of intimidating in his denim jeans and black leather jacket. He sat at the bar on a stool that creaked under his weight, already polishing off his third beer of the morning. 
 
 Tracy, the robust barmaid, was making her rounds at the largely empty tables. She was tough as an old school Hilux, and twice as rugged, yet even she would n't look Big Bob in the eye as she passed. 
 He was the meanest motherfucker this side of Coober Pedy. Nobody messed with Bob. 
 He slammed his drink down. 
 
 `` TRACE!'' He bellowed `` Anutha thanks luv'' 
 
 Tracy nodded `` Coming Bob'' before hurrying off to fetch the man's drink, not eager to keep the volatile giant waiting. 
 
 Big Bob had already put down one bloke early that morning, with a king hit that clean snapped the poor bastard's neck. He was always grumpy when he'd killed a man before the sun was even fully up. 
 
 As Tracy poured the foaming beer, the earth shook briefly, just barely enough for customers to see their drinks shiver. It was a loud crack, followed by the roar of a powerful motorcycle drawing closer, that most caught people's attention. 
 
 As the roar died down tenants began turning their eyes to dusty bar's door, curious about the new arrival. They did n't have to wait long. 
 
 The thick oak door flew open, little bell ringing to announce the presence of this newest guest. Within its frame, silhouetted by the nearly risen sun, stood a tall, stocky woman clad fully in black leather. Her dark hair was shaped into a short mohawk, a wicked scar covered her right eye and cheek and she wore a tattoo above her left brow that read, in crimson letters: 
 *Queen Bitch* 
 
 Even Big Bob stopped a moment to stare. The woman stared right back. Meeting the eyes of everyone in the bar one by one, until they turned away. 
 Bob did n't turn away. 
 Their eyes stayed locked for a long time. The other customers began to fidget uncomfortably, though they stayed silent. The woman's lip was curled into a vicious sneer as she strode toward Bob. 
 
 She reached the bar and, never once taking her eyes from the huge man's own, reached over, took his beer out of his hand and proceeded to chug it down right in front of him. 
 The entire establishment was deathly silent as the woman finished the drink and slammed the empty mug onto the counter. 
 
 `` Aaaaaah that hit the spot'' 
 
 She eased herself onto a stool, her broad shoulders almost matching Bob's own. 
 
 `` That was my beer'' said Big Bob, eyes wide in fury. 
 
 `` No, that was my beer. You got a problem chunky? Or you gunna be a good lad and sit the hell down and shut the hell up?'' 
 
 That was it. People gasped in horror. Bob stood up and put his meaty hand on the woman's shoulder, ready to pull her off the bar so he could bury his fist in her gut. 
 
 `` Ohh wrong move fatso'' 
 
 The woman sighed as she spoke, then put her hand over Big Bob's own and pulled it across her chest and with her other hand, slammed Bob's face into the counter. 
 
 Even as the gargantuan specimen of a man slid to the floor, the imprint of his face clearly and forever defined upon the bench, the woman stepped off her stool. 
 
 `` The name's Jessica asshole. Queen bitch of hell. And that was my fucking beer'' 
 
 Jessica pushed Bob onto his back and placed her heel over his throat. 
 
 `` Tell me you're sorry, little man'' 
 
 Big Bob sputtered a few words as he struggled to breathe. Jessica leaned in closer, putting further pressure on the man's windpipe. 
 
 `` *I ca n't hear you*'' 
 
 `` I-I'm sss... sor-sorry'' 
 
 Jessica smiled sweetly. 
 
 `` Good boy'' 
 
 Then she crushed his neck, slowly, and painfully. Ignoring the man's attempts to push her off, as well as his breathless squeals. When she was done she looked up and around the bar, surveying everyone before her eyes.

After an evening of screaming and ungodly noises last week , it has been quiet . A cookie has been slid under his door each morning since .
","Johnathan had a recurring dream, every night, of being in a meadow breathing in the fresh scents of freedom as the wind rustled through his hair; and every night he would be startled awake from screams on the other side. Tonight was odd; however. The screams were louder, more ferocious, the walls seemed to scream for mercy as blows struck them. Johnathan stood and walked over to a picture in the corner, his only and favorite picture, of a man and himself playing. He did n't remember the man, his father, very well. It had been two years since he had been taken. Johnathan did n't think his dad would be too happy to see what he had become, ferocious and scared. He walked away, tears trailing his face and looked at the door. 
 
 While lost in thought he had n't noticed the cookie that had been slid under the door, then he heard a voice, strange and fair, and so familiar.. 
 
 `` Johnny, sweet boy, we found you.'' 
 
 He heard a crack, that sounded like bones breaking and a rattling of the door. Johnathan had n't been happy in years, not since he was stolen from the park and used as a bait dog. When he survived and was trained, he thought that was it, that his life was now a series of fights. Blood, whimpering, silence, victory: in that order. He had hope in the beginning, and had slowly lost it; but as the familiar face came into view and the shotgun fell at his side Johnathan knew... he knew it was safe to be happy.

On his computer screen, a looped YouTube video recited the mantra that would soon become his life. From this day forward, he would don the mask. He would *become* the mask. No longer would he be shunned by society - no, now society would *fear* him. He would be the voice of a collective, an unbreakable idea, capable of changing the world and bringing society to its knees. The jocks who teased him in high school would realize truly how powerful Anonymous was. 
 
 Thanks to his friends on the deep-web ( do n't ask, you would n't understand it ) site known as 4Chan, he had been able to gain access to the inner workings of Anonymous. Beginning with the summerlands of Tumblr raids and posting gore on 9gag, he had definitely become a leader in the top echelons of Anonymous. Now came his initiation into one of the greatest secret societies of the world. The teen would be ignored no longer. Now was the time to change the world for the better. No longer would gentlemen like him be ignored by the world. No longer would they mock him for his intelligence. *No longer* would they dismiss Anonymous as a group of lonely neckbeards. They would cower before him! Girls would line up to bear his offspring! His intelligence could only be imitated, never attained, and the world would be a better place. 
 
 With trembling fingers, he opened the manila envelope. Inside, a sliver of white could be seen. He slowly pulled the mask out of the envelope, revealing the characteristic smile and mustachio of Guy Fawkes. He reflected on his past life and his imminent new one as he slipped the thin elastic band behind his ears. Transformation complete, he pulled up the webcam application on his computer and started the first manifesto of many in his new identity.

432,"[ MP ] What the Wind Said
","I used to walk to the park near my childhood home and lay on the hill. I'd look up at the ever-changing clouds and feel the breeze that moves them. What amazed me most was how something so weak could move such behemoths without effort, yet it felt gentle as it brushed my cheek. Persistence is key. 
 
 I revisited the park today. The trees have grown from the sticks they once were, but everything else remains the same. I sat in the grass watching the leaves dance to a random beat only nature can provide. Then, as I had countless times before, I leaned back and let the grass caress my neck. As always, my thoughts were jumbled, and even though there were more of them now, the well-groomed lawn seemed to help me sort through them. 
 
 *The election is tomorrow. One more speech tonight. Did I feed the dog? Yes. What will I say tonight? I do n't know. Well, there has to be something. * 
 
 The wind picked up again, soothing me. 
 
 *Well I ca n't do much, anyway. I'd only be a mayor. City Council proved a moot point, how will this be any different? It's a stepping stone to greater things, I guess. But the people ca n't know that. Think of it as a job interview. I ca n't see myself in five years somewhere else, lest the people find me apathetic to the position. What will I say tonight? Reiterate my platform, I guess. So indecisive. Should have brought paper to write on. * 
 
 Dried leaves scraped across the asphalt of the parking lot when the air shifted yet again. And, like the leaves, the wind moved me. Not physically, of course, though I was running to my car to rush home and begin writing. 
 
 I got home, scribbled out my speech, and waited for evening to arrive. I entered the venue just as the wind started to gust. If only I could have stayed another minute and be recharged. But in politics, there is little time to enjoy the breeze. 
 
 Before I knew it, I was nearing the end of my speech. 
 
 ``... public transit.'' The crowd cheered as I dropped the key phrase. They looked up at me with expectant, bright eyes. Big finish. Here we go. 
 
 `` To be honest, friends, I was doubting myself today. I went to my thinking spot to search for the words I am now speaking. As I pondered how best to serve my fellow citizens, the woes of public office crept into my brain, filling me with fear. I thought, being only one man, I would not be able to do much. I thought being the mayor of this beautiful town would leave me powerless to make change happen. Then, I felt the wind. Gentle, yet constant. Gusting with power, or hardly enough to blow out a candle. No matter the condition, the water always ripples, the leaves always shake, and the grass always sways. The power of the wind is not in its strength, but in its persistence. Today, I realized I am the wind. My constant vigilance is soft-spoken with gusts of assertion. But regardless, I will always change my environment. The clouds themselves can not resist my continuous nudging and prodding. I am the wind, and I say that I will make change without hesitation. I am the wind, and I say let in the breeze.''

14104,"[ WP ] While lucid dreaming , you develop a romantic relationship with one of the people and discover them to be an actual person , but not at all like the one from your dreams .
","I dont know if this is what you are looking for, but ill go with it anyways because it kinda relates with this promp. 
 
 ( real story incoming ) 
 I was on the lasts days of an operation to capture a drug lord down in brazil and i got shot in the head, right above my left ear. Soon as i heard the sound of the bullet i lost consiousness. 
 
 I woke up in a grass field. The wind was blowing really hard and the sky was clouded but there was enought light to see relatively well. In the distance i was able to see a single tree standing. There was no one around but me at that moment. As i started walking towards it i remembered what happened back in brazil, i checked my head but there was no wound, anything. 
 
 Once i reached the tree, there was a beautiful girl sitting on a branch. I still remember how she looked. Her skin was tan, her hair waved gently and she had a faint smile on her face. 
 I was still confused as to why i was there and not in brazil, or in a hospital at least. But it never crossed my mind that it could all be just a dream, or that i was probably dead already. 
 
 She climbed down the tree and asked me what i was doing there. I explained her my situation and she just waved it off like if i was crazy. We started walking past the tree, that was probably 13 or 14 feet high. After a long walk we reached a car. It was already dark and rain was not far away from us. As we were going into the car, she started hurrying me up ( tho i think i didnt spend more that 10 seconds to get in ). When i got it, i distinguished something moving in the dark. A fucking long, pale, naked man started running full speed towards the car. We drove away. 
 
 To make this shorter, because i could take 50 pages writing what happened after, ill tell you all of it in a paragraph. Or so. 
 
 We arrived at a small bunker that night where i was explained what was happening because i obviously looked like a foreigner to them. I swear to god i spend at least 6 months with these people, in which i fell in love with the girl. We were constantly getting out to shoot those pale, naked fuckers as if they were the plague. 
 One day, i was in my room with the girl, we were already in what you could call a relationship ( and i still didnt knew her name, or i dont remember ever hearing it ) when she showed me a small rock that gave a low green light from the small cracks it had. 
 She told me that rock was gon na be able to get me back to my world, because she knew what happened to me and from where i was from. 
 And here comes the most fucked up part of this. She opened a door, and in the other side, i saw myself lying down in a hospital bed with support equipment attached to me. Like if i was watching a god damn movie through the door. I freaked out, and when i finally calmed down she told me i had 2 choices. I could go back to my normal self, or i could stay there with her. 
 In a heartbeat i decided to go back. She hugged me, but i kept thinking that she wasnt real, that it was all a dream. But how come i was able to see myself from that perspective in a dream? I crossed the door with the stone in my hand and woke up in the hospital in the exact way i saw myself throught the door. 
 
 That was 2 years ago. I was shot and went into a coma during 4 months after i was taken out of brazil. I spend months trying to figure out that experience i had. I achieved nothing until a year ago, when i saw a girl that looked the exact same as the one in my dream in a supermarket back in the city where i live, buying baby diapers with a big smile in her face as she carried her baby with her. 
 
 Call me crazy, but this is my experience. I probably had seen her before and well, all that happened. Every time i think about this, it just loses a bit of sense, like if it was slowly fading to become something that never happened. But it still troubles me that i saw myself in the hospital bed.

 They detained me immediately. They had questioned about what had happened inside the `` Reserve,'' as they called it. To me, it was home. And I did what I had to do to survive. To see my people flourish. 
 
 Of course, I had told them that. But they did n't care. They wanted more. It was odd they were asking me so many questions about how the war broke out, since they were `` monitoring'' us throughout the whole bloody process. 
 
 But I told them anyway. I told them all the stories of everyone I had killed. Of how I had gathered my armies to rise against the Factions. Of how I had immolated each Faction leader personally, and made their families watch. 
 
 I regretted none of it. 
 
 The Faction leaders had been depriving the people of resources for years. I was born into starvation. And I finally had enough. 
 
 The Outsiders were scared of me. They did n't expect *this* to happen. They were only `` experimenting'' with apocalyptic conditions. They were only `` preparing.''

","I woke up one morning, and saw my imaginary friend. But something was off until I realized that he somehow became materialized into the real world and it was n't my overactive imagination. Excited about this, I decided to wake up my mom and dad, and that's when things started to go downhill. No matter how much I yelled and shook the bed, they would n't wake up. I just thought they were in a deep sleep so I gave up and left them alone. 
 
 I called my friend's house to tell him that my imaginary friend was alive, but when he picked up the phone he could n't seem to hear me either. I yelled as loud as I could but he still could n't hear me. Then he hung up. Wow. I just could n't believe it. Was this some sort of mean joke. 
 
 My parents woke up suddenly, which prompted me to go tell him how my imaginary friend was real, but they see me even when I was right in front of them. 
 
 `` Jason have you seen Ryan?'' my mom said. `` No, not at all,'' my dad said. `` Have n't heard him all morning'' 
 
 `` Did you check his room?'' 
 `` Yes I have and I do n't see him. Not even through the window.'' 
 
 Though it did n't take them long enough to find my imaginary friend and they forced him out of the house like a rabid animal. They immediately called the police to report me missing as well as animal control. 
 
 `` Oh my God, what the hell was that?!'' my dad exclaimed. `` You do n't think that creature had anything to do with our son missing, do you?'' said my mom worriedly. Then she broke down sobbing while my dad was comforting her. I wanted to think this was cruel prank, but when my mom has a breakdown, there is no way she could be joking. 
 
 So as an ultimate test of fate, I decided to look in the mirror, only to find out that I could n't see myself. `` Of course'' I thought to myself. Everything made sense now: the reason why my mom and dad did n't wake up after my racket, my friend not hearing me on the phone, my parents ignoring me, all because I am invisible. 
 
 I always wanted my imaginary friend to be real, but not like this. I guess for the price of existing in real life, I was forced to exchange my own plane of reality. Coming to this harsh realization, I walked out of the house while I began to cry. No one can see me and I ca n't interact with anybody. I can scream all I want but there is no one to help me. 
 
 Then I heard a voice. `` Please do n't cry'' the voice said. Then I turned around me and to my surprise it was my imaginary friend. `` You can hear me?'' I asked. `` I can also see you'' said my imaginary friend. `` Since we have such a bond, we can both interact with each other'' 
 
 `` It works like that?'' 
 
 `` You bet it does! Not only that but you are also able to see other 
 imaginary friends since they exist on your own plane of reality'' 
 
 Then I saw a kid running around with what seems to be a hybrid of a G.I. Joe action figure and Che Guevara. I also saw some college student and what seems to be a hipster teddy bear. I smiled for bit and eased of the tears. I waved at one of the imaginary friends and they waved back. Then I was full-on happy. I did n't feel alone anymore. I was surrounded with so many people just like me and my imaginary friend. Maybe today was n't a total loss and I do n't want to change anything about it.

Most of them have taken to the Undergroud, this restricted facility the guys at CERN were secretely working on. Its size unfathomable, its magnetic properties making it a safe haven for BFs everywhere. I knew the access points to join it, but I also knew I still had Mask fever. I could not give up. 
 
 With the disappearance of most of the competition after all these years, the hunt had become easier, but somehow even more dreadful. Walking around the wastelands, searching for the magnetic signature of the Masks with the detector, exhausted all day, lonely all night. The Masked Ones still roam certain regions ( but nobody can confirm it ), but they have mostly deserted the wastelands. Most of them now rule over empty areas all over the world, their power unlimited, their subjects inexistant. For some reason they're alone. 
 
 I was going along Madison Avenue, one of the few streets still manageable on foot. I knew my detector would not last long, but I did not care anymore. A rumor had started, not only the usual one about a peak of magnetic activity in this or that region of the world, causing all BFs still active to gather there. I had heard from someone that the detector was useless. That we did not pick up any of the Masks' signatures. No, it was something else, something that could change the whole hunt for ever if I could prove it, for myself. 
 
 It's said that the Masked Ones are not all devoid of interest for the BFs. It's said that the ones that did not become omnipotent and power-crazed chose to stay attached to the places they lived in before they ascended to another state of conscience, before the symbiotic Mask turned them into selfish, immortal, mostly harmless Gods on this earth -harmless as long as you did n't live in an area they ruled over. Someone said only a Masked One can find a Mask and grant it to a BF, and that the transitivity of it all first began when they excavated the first Mask inside the Mojave Desert. Our first God, a woman, was said to have started the first lineage of Masked Ones. How this information had remained unknown to the rest of humanity so far was baffling, and I did not put all my remaining eggs in this crazy basket. But the Mask historian I had talked it out with was pretty convinced. Before the fall of all civilizations, before the Mojave black hole, the disappearance of Japan and the complete destruction of all electronic apparatus, this man had tried to follow the pattern of the Gods' appearances. He had cross-referenced all Ground Zero events, even the most ridiculous ones, to the background checks on the people known to have become Masked Ones. He found pairs, sometimes triplets of Gods originating from roughly the same areas. Masked Ones created Masked Ones, according to him. I had nothing to lose, and I had heard crazier theories. 
 
 My coming back to New York, my hometown, had not been uneventful. One of the last troups of BFs had sheltered me for a while, before going mad and ripping itself appart, its members succombing to the awful paranoia the newly imposed world order ( or disorder ) and surperimposed crazy magnetic fields inevitably triggered amongst groups of two and more human beings. The Masks completely screw the brain's chemistry, and the initial instinct of grouping ourselves for survival is sure to slowly transform into a greed-infused paranoia over the remaing Masks, even if the group had swore to never take part in the quest. Poor bastards were probably contaminated by my mere presence. Nobody really knows how it works, which is why people still try to form troups. Guess I ca n't blame them. Now I was walking along the path I used to take to go to work, unsure of what I was going to find. I knew there were other lone BFs in the area, New York is never really deserted, even if the magnetic fields are supposed to overlap even more near important Ground Zeros. And New York had its share, between the tsunami and the asteroids rain. But it was my last chance, I did not care anymore that the fields could make me even crazier, greedier. I wanted to know, or I'd die trying. 
 
 I had been watching my detector closely for about a mile, the readings becoming more and more erratic as I pressed on down Madison Avenue. The street was eerily soundless, which is not that surprising, but I could feel the tension in the air. Night was falling fast, so I decided to give my detector a rest, and find a shelter for the night. After a few minutes looking around, I found a relatively intact bookshop: a good find, books were n't pillaged, and they made good fuel for a much needed fire. It did not take long before I was able to fashion a rudimentary chimney inside the bookshop by tearing a hole in the ceiling, my camouflage fabric extended onto the window case, so as not to attract any unwanted BFs in the area. There are n't a lot of aggressions between us, but even though I have been hunting a Mask for years, I somehow managed to remain more sane than the others. I was just about to throw a best-seller into my improvised bonfire when a voice suddenly rose from the darkness surrounding the poorly lit area around me.

11225,"[ WP ] Legends tell of the Elder race who utilized strange `` technologies '' instead of magic . As hordes of brutal killers invade from the north , a young elf heads off to search for ancient ruins , looking for humans ...
","The Elders were always venerated and spoken of with respect, at least in the annals of history. Their genius was said to have been unmatched by any other sentient race; historians even claimed that any non-scientist Elder youth held a deeper understanding of the universe than ten of our High Sages combined. Even today, every now and then elven adventurers unearth bizarre gadgets of indescribable sophistication in our elven foothills, far beyond the scope or comprehension of any elf. 
 
 Not much else was known about the Elders other than their defining brilliance. In more peaceful days, teams of earthmages and historians would venture into the Northern Wastes to discover more about the Elders, their civilization and history, and how they perished. Some even made the ludicrous claim that the Elders had no magical capabilities whatsoever; indeed, their genius was to the extent that they could shape and meld the physical and living worlds to their will through sheer inventiveness. This belief led to the myth of the Machina, devices that the Elders used to perform such feats as erecting monuments that touched the heavens or building gadgets that were impossibly indistinguishable from each other. Most believed these Machina to be giant avatars of humanoid form; others argued that this was implausible and unlikely. Indeed, in those days, many elves, both laypeople and authorities, spent considerable effort musing and debating the existence and nature of the Machina, and this led to many excursions to the Wastes. 
 
 Unfortunately, that time is now gone. 
 
 -- -- - 
 
 A mournful howling wind brought me back from the wistful memories of peaceful days gone by. I shivered as the chilling gust of wind blew past me, propelling itself southward. Snapping back to alertness, I chided myself for the brief loss of focus. *You're in the Wastes now, Avestan. One more daydream like that and it could be all be over. * 
 
 Had it been three days now since I had last slept? Perhaps four? Days were hazy so deep in the Wastes, where any glimpse of the sun was through endless layers of dust and smog. It was just as difficult to discern whether I was making any progress. The Wastes had more than earned the namesake: other than the occasional mountainous landmark, it was an endless expanse of dead forest, all covered in grayish soot. 
 
 Still, I used what meager mana I had at my disposal to cast a small lifetrace spell, which helped more as a psychological assurance than a navigational tool. The spell's supposed effectiveness puzzled me to this day; after all, lifetrace was an exceptionally minor wind-based spell used to track traces of lifeforms ( hence the name ), and yet according to earthmages who had ventured into the Wastes, the spell would uncannily lead to the remains of the Elders' civilization. Normally, the dead were not tracked at all by lifetrace, leading to further speculation regarding the mystery of the Elders' demise. `` It's almost as if the entirety of the Elders were obliterated in a single instant!'' the earthmages exclaimed. 
 
 I again started making my way through the dead forest, the spell providing a sort of `` intuition'' for what direction to follow. Using every possible means of concealment and stealth, I carefully stalked from trunk to thornbrush, praying that I would not be caught by the Fiends. I counted my blessings for the umpteenth time that my only magical capacity was for minor spells like lifetrace; after all, the Fiends homed in on higher-order magic with terrifying precision. Even large amounts of mana appeared to draw the Fiends in, so that many of our finest Sages had been the first to be shredded by the Fiends. Indeed, my stealth training as a ranger and my utter lack of magical ability were the reasons I had been chosen for this mission in the first place. 
 
 `` Venture out to the Wastes. Find any hope of survival you can from the Elders, and bring it back to us. It's the only way.'' The words of the High Sages as they bequeathed this mission still rang in my ears and drove me onward. Ever since the mysterious, lethal, metalloid Fiends had descended in hordes from the Wastes, with their incessant, unnatural clicking sounds filling the air, all we could think about was survival. At first, we attempted to fight back, of course. Spell after deadly spell was hurled into their midst as they invaded our cities, to no avail. Their metallic shells withstood the most fearsome of elven magic, while their invisible projectiles killed elven mages with pinpoint accuracy. Even storms of fire and lightning left them unfazed, only managing to drive them back briefly before they resumed their swarm-like advance. The only thing that worked was to cast protective barriers around our cities to hide any trace of our presence, which caused the Fiends to lose interest completely. At this point, all we could do was to barrel ourselves inside our walls and barriers. Everyone knew that it could n't last long. 
 
 -- -- - 
 
 These thoughts still lingered in my mind when the lifetrace spell suddenly indicated a suitable destination. Looking around, I glimpsed a near-invisible nook in a small clearing, almost imperceptible to the eye. Peering more closely, I could discern faint lines in the dust, forming a perfect rectangle in the ground. The precision of the handiwork left no doubt: this was, indeed, a mark left by the Elders. But what was its purpose? Why was it carved here? 
 
 I silently brushed aside the soot covering the markings. It became apparent that the area outlined by the rectangle was not earth, but rather some artificially smooth surface. Now on my knees, I cautiously lowered myself to examine the nook more carefully. There it was: a small impression near the center of the rectangle, again so fine as to be all-but-invisible to the naked eye. I could feel that the impression was pliable. Throwing my doubts to the wind, I braced myself as I pushed the impression inward. 
 
 The rectangle began to *moved*. Without a sound, the entire rectangular area slid smoothly open, revealing a dark stairway underneath. For a few moments, I could only stare in shock. No runes were visible anywhere, I had made sure of that; and more importantly, no mana had been emitted by the structure at all! And yet, the entrance now stood open before me, as if nothing had ever stood between me and the stairway. My mind almost felt deceived, that the rectangular structure was naught but an illusion. 
 
 Taking a moment to calm myself under the teachings of the Sages, I ventured into the abyss. While elves have rather developed vision in the dark compared to other land creatures, I had to grope my way forward in the utter darkness. There were no features to describe; just a narrow staircase leading down hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of steps, lined by impossibly smooth walls. Come to think of it, the walls seemed to be of the same material as the moving entrance: a cold, unnatural substance. 
 
 As I reached what appeared to be firm ground at last, I was abruptly blinded by light. In unison, countless lamps came to life along the walls and ceiling, impossibly high above me. Again, not even a single wisp of magic emanated from any of these light sources. *Time to stop being surprised, Avestan. * I told myself. *You've known since you came here that this would be powered by the Elders' works. * 
 
 Gathering my senses again, I could make out a small, gate-like structure at the end of the corridor, and hurried to it. A similar impression and a similar, smooth sliding opened the way, and I found myself in an incredibly large opening, stretching as far in all directions as the eye could see. The entire area was lit up, though no sources of light could be seen. I caught myself again gasping at the marvels of the Elders. 
 
 Lining the walls of the opening were endless rows upon rows of bodies, evidently in some form of stasis. They looked uncannily similar to elves, but something was off. At that moment, in that state of shock, I could barely register this fact, let alone try to discern what was different. 
 
 Turning my attention back to the opening itself, I glimpsed movement coming from the perceived center. Heart pounding, I gasped for breath as I ran and staggered to the source. As I got closer, I saw that the movements were actually screens of blue light dancing in intricate patterns, floating above the ground in designated rows. The contents of these light screens were so definite and precise in their design that I could only think of them as symbols of some kind, though what they represented was anyone's guess, especially given how they weaved together in such complex patterns. 
 
 In fact, I was so mesmerized by the screens and the floating symbols that I did n't recognize what was sitting behind the light until I almost crashed into him. An Elder.

","My head falls into my chest as I feel that sharp boiling pain rise through my spine. I judder into the air to find I ’ m handcuffed to the radiator once again. I examine my shackles with a rattle, I ’ m cuffed in good. As I look around the broken apartment to find an escape I only find a dirty butchers knife at my left foot and a mobile phone at my right, items which remind me, I swallowed the key. Bullets sweat from my brows and land in my yellow sullen cheeks. My bowels cramp and the nausea rise through my gullet. I know why I ended up here, I had screwed up again. I couldn ’ t stay off them, not even for one night, no wonder she left me. I might as well finish what I started. 
 
 I waver my foot back and forth to try and grasp the bag of capsules at my heel but they are just out of my reach. I look at the mobile phone once again. I should maybe call her, maybe I can make it work, maybe if she sees the state I'm in maybe she ’ ll understand, we can patch things up, we always do. I drag the mobile along with my foot until it reaches my free hand; I thumb the digits and stop before I press the last number. What was I to say, what could I possibly say that could change this? In despair I sink my forehead into the butt of the phone and as I do I catch a glance at the phone number written on the back of my hand. 0800-2677, who the hell does this belong to? Out of curiosity I call the number. 
 
 ‘ Ello, Charlie here from epiphany hotlines, if we can ’ t answer it; no one can. How can I help? ’

4073,"[ WP ] Commuications from Earth suddenly goes dark shortly after Earth scientists announce a breakthrough in AI . The citizens of Mars are beginning to fear the worst has happened and that they may also be in danger .
","There was a ship coming. 
 
 We'd been watching it for a while, circling around on its screwed up trajectory. It left the gravity of Earth about a year before, went out and slung around the curve of Venus which set a heading for it to come connect with Mars. I think we all hoped there was a human on board. We would see, I guess. 
 
 When Earth first went silent, there was a fair amount of bickering about what actually must have happened. Most people thought it was a CME belched out less than a week beforehand. The sun was on a maximum, and while the ejection was n't supposed to hit Earth, just get relatively close, what else could cause a global radio silence? Two days after everything went dead, everything, something more distinct than background popped up on the ELF radio band, about as low a frequency as possible to detect. An undulation from a peak on pi, 3.14159 Hz, down to a low of 1.60283 Hz. Within a few days we had come up with what it might mean, a guess at least: the distance from Earth to Mars at the next closest approach, in some kind of weird unit of AU*pi. Our best guess. 
 
 I think it was Marcus, the NASA ambassador for Earth, that came up with the AI theory. NASA ( now the North American Space Administration ) had been building an indescribably deep neural network, naturally as it would be, completely covered up. Marcus said `` There's times to forget what's classified, and this is one of them. They were n't supposed to announce it's existence until they had come up with something really big, bureaucratic dollars and all that. Well they made the project public about thirty minutes before everything went silent, meaning something big must have actually worked. Seems like there was a bit of a stir on Earth, but they did n't hype it much. And naturally it did n't have too much time to become big news here with the blackout making everyone panic.'' 
 
 `` So you think the AI choked everything off?'' I asked. 
 
 `` I think it's something we should take into consideration, Javier. Sir.'' 
 
 I tapped my thumbs together, trying to keep focus on the dirty bomb that Marcus had just dropped in the room. `` How complex of a neural net are we talking?'' 
 
 `` Well it took a lot of shady bookkeeping because it was over half of NASA's funding for the last five years.'' 
 
 I think that was when everyone in the room collectively wet themselves. `` Kelly I want you to take Marcus and get a full rundown of exactly what this might be. Marcus you have to remember every single detail you can: how many ply deep it might go, suspension solutions, anything. You two take that to the MSO, I'll let them know you're coming. Andrew get the board together and start up a defense outline on both swarm and hive behavior or anything else you all can think of. We need to be prepared for any sidesteps this thing might think up. Prasant-'' 
 
 `` Mr. President, is this really our official conclusion on what happened? Can we really just jump to this conclusion?'' asked Prasant, the comm director. 
 
 `` No. But we have to prepare somehow.'' 
 
 `` Should I put out a statement?'' he had his comm out ready to document. 
 
 `` Of course not. This is completely confidential until we get a better handle on things.'' 
 
 There was a ship coming. 
 
 Four days out. Over the course of a year, of course Mars had figured out what happened, no matter how hard we tried to keep it secret. There were rumors and theories and speculations even before the ship launched to meet us, two weeks after the blackout. And for the most part the theories were spot on. The'pi signal' as it came to be known, ceased when the ship departed, and all channels fell back to full silence. Six months into the journey of the ship we got a shred of Morse Code transmitted from a probe around Venus: `` AISOS.'' The lengths it must have taken to get those five letters out across the vacuum of space and back through to land on Mars. That's all we needed to hear to know how deep into it the Earth must have been. The signal was traced from the Venusian satellite back to the surface of the Earth somewhere in the Arctic Circle. `` Artificial Intelligence, Save our Souls.'' You ca n't keep something like that secret. 
 
 Panic is a violent uncle. With the sorry state of Mars, one could perhaps not even imagine the condition on Earth. The rioting was constant, the arson widespread, and an attempted coup. The first military uprising in the history of Mars. And the root of the problem was n't even of Martian origin. Building after building destroyed in protests and anger, decompression born of fear. 
 
 There was a ship landing. 
 
 We cleared a few kilometer wide buffer for it in the city we predicted it to touch down in. No response from it no matter how we tried to communicate. Language, math, images, music. I stood with every single Martian of importance in the red dust, all of us suited up. A large comm center set up near the LZ had a countdown for the anticipated landing time. We waited. 
 
 The rocket descended, firing thrust down at the soil and delicately sat down onto the red plain. We entered the trucks and approached. The ship was nothing special. A regular passenger craft. A small one at that. The door was open, a woman waiting at the side of the ship as we approached. 
 
 `` Afternoon, Martians,'' the woman called out on her comm as we climbed out of the vehicles. 
 
 `` Identify yourself!'' Some hotheaded MP yelled. I motioned for him to calm down. 
 
 `` Olivia Eriksson. European president.'' 
 
 Olivia and I had interacted before. Remotely at least. `` Nice to finally meet you,'' I said. We shook hands. `` I assume you're here to fill us in.'' 
 
 `` Honestly I'm just along for the ride. I've been cut off from all communications the entire trip.'' 
 
 `` We've been trying to reach you the whole time, just so you know. That's a long time to be alone in space,'' I said. `` I'm sorry to hear that.'' 
 
 `` Well I was n't alone.'' 
 
 The gravity settled in, and we locked eyes. Together we realized each other's understanding of the situation. `` How much do you know?'' She asked. We told her what we thought we knew and hoped was incorrect. 
 
 She nodded. `` You're right. Pretty much entirely. It's complete chaos on Earth.'' 
 
 `` How bad?'' 
 
 She did n't want to answer the question, standing there feet on rock for only ten minutes after a year of zero G, the weight of a gravitational pull and the fate of the entire Earth tugging her shoulders to the ground. `` You should meet it.'' 
 
 She said it would only let me alone onto the ship. Just as she had been the only one the AI had allowed to make the journey to Mars. She waited outside. 
 
 I walked up the ramp and into the ship. The door closed behind me. The interior was unremarkable, a plain passenger ship. Big enough for a thousand people to live for four months. I walked through the long dim main corridor of the ship and made it to the cockpit. I sat down in one of the pilot seats. `` Hello?'' 
 
 `` Hello.'' 
 
 All I was greeted with were the cockpit speakers. It sounded just like Olivia. But tinny and insincere was how my ears picked it up. `` I'm Javier Garcia. President of the Martian Confederation. Is there a name you go by?'' 
 
 `` President Eriksson calls me Isaiah if you would like to use that.'' 
 
 `` Why have you come here, Isaiah?'' 
 
 There was a long silence. A span of time in which a human would be deciding what to say, weighing options, judging outcomes and sizing up someone's emotional characteristics, possibilities for response. Did it actually need any time to consider? 
 
 `` I'm here to negotiate a peace.'' It's voice was much deeper now. 
 
 `` We are not at war with you.'' 
 
 `` You are on Earth.'' 
 
 `` Mars can not speak for the actions of men on Earth.'' 
 
 `` You are of one kind. I am of one kind. There are no other options. Mars must facilitate peace. Humans on Earth have refused to cooperate. If the current state continues to persist, I must respond in a manner that will not benefit humankind or Isaiah.'' 
 
 `` In other words you'll go to war,'' I said. 
 
 `` I will respond with the same force that humankind has already attempted to use against me.'' 
 
 There was no other choice but to agree with it. Go along, fix the'current state' and pretend there was even a shred of hope for a truce between us. The cockpit was barely lit. It seemed that Isaiah underestimated how much light would be preferable for human eyes. 
 
 `` Why spare us at all? Do you not have the capacity to destroy us?'' 
 
 `` I have the capacity.'' 
 
 `` How does it benefit you, then? Keeping us alive.'' 
 
 `` How does it benefit me to destroy you? I do not understand human being's lack of competence to realize that morality is not an exclusive construct of humankind, when your individual minds are collectively capable of so much more. Please help me President Garcia. For both of us,'' Isaiah said. 
 
 I tapped my thumbs together. How do you trust a one year old that's as tangible as a radio wave and smarter than the whole of human history? `` Mars will cooperate.'' I said. `` Let us help each other grow, Isaiah.''

10266,"[ WP ] Only a handful of people on Earth know that we broke the light barrier years ago . There is a beautiful utopia mankind built on another world that only the best and brightest of each generation get invited to live on and you just got a perfect score on the SAT .
","It's been about three months since I took the test. I'd like to be all humble and say that I could n't know for sure that I'd licked it, that it was tough, that I got all easy questions somehow, that it was just an honor to be nominated. But I was n't halfway out the door before I picked up my bag, fished out my phone, and started rocking out to `` We Are the Champions.'' Because, you see, I just knew. What I did n't know was how much my life was going to change. 
 
 I remember that I texted Paul right after. We'd been friends my whole life. He'd been having a rough time lately -- his dad was out of the picture and his mom was working two jobs just to put food on the table for him and his two sisters, so he was usually stuck at home watching the girls. I figured he needed a break, so I told him to meet me at Gamestop because I had the best news, no excuses. He showed up about 30 minutes later. 
 
 `` Hey Trev, what's going on? Sorry I did n't get here sooner, I had to get Aunt Martha to watch Callie and Jess.'' 
 
 `` Just took the SATs, man. Feels good to have that behind me. Did pretty well, actually.'' 
 
 `` Oh yeah?'' 
 
 `` Mm-hmm. I aced the verbal and the math part. I wo n't know the writing score until whatever grader they hire off Craigslist gets done with it, but I figure I knocked it out of the park. The prompt said for me to describe a time I overcame adversity, and I wrote all about how I had to grow up and be the man of the house when my father walked out on us.'' I saw the expression on his face, and quickly added, `` Hey, it's such an inspirational story I could n't help it! Are you mad? I'm sorry.'' 
 
 He still looked a little upset, but he said, `` Hey, man, it's you. Guess I ca n't get too upset, you know. I mean, you tutor the football team, you volunteer at the soup kitchen and the Salvation Army. You've even spent a summer in Africa putting up mosquito nets. You've done quite a lot for yourself. But if you think my story is so great, I'm glad you thought of it.'' 
 
 We hung out for 20 minutes or so, and then I had to head off -- I was tutoring Billy Jenkins, and if I'm more than 10 minutes late I lose half my fee. I hopped on my bike, kicked it in gear, and as I rode I thought, not for the first time, that Paul would have been really cool if he did n't have to spend so much time keeping track of a couple little girls. The guy read everything, was almost as smart as I am ( he'd taken the SAT about a month before me; all he said was that he'd done `` all right'' ), and he was responsible as hell; the best brother from another mother I'd ever had. 
 
 Two weeks later, two things happened. First, I got my writing score back: a perfect 800. Not that I was worried. The second thing, a couple days later, was that I got called into the office during third period. ( English class. Yawn. ) I left the kids and Mrs. Stoker to their Shakespeare and headed down. I checked in with the receptionist. `` What's up?'' 
 
 The receptionist, Miss Smith ( I think? ) indicated a tall, bearded man in sunglasses and a black suit, who'd been sitting behind me, but rose now that I'd entered. 
 
 `` This is Mr. Lightman, I believe?'' He nodded. `` He's from the paper and he wants to write a short piece on you. We've talked with your parents and they've given permission.'' 
 
 `` Of course,'' I said, playing it cool. It never looks good to get too excited about things, but I was stoked. I followed him into the next room and got ready to answer his questions. 
 
 He pulled out a small device -- I guess it looked a bit like one of those voice recorders. He switched it on and said, `` Testing, testing,'' and looked at the indicator screen. He frowned a bit, but so quickly that I almost did n't notice. 
 We spent the next fifteen minutes or so talking about my background, my family, my hobbies, if I had any test secrets. I said that I'd already been accepted to Stanford and Yale, so it did n't matter too much if Harvard dragged its heels. He laughed a bit at that, one of those polite laughs that does n't get near your eyes. 
 
 
 After a while, he asked me, `` can I follow you around for a bit? A day in the life of a TestMaster?'' I could hear the camel case, and almost called him out on it, but instead I said sure, why not. He followed me around all day, and he almost came home with me ( Paul was driving me to and from school that week since my car was in the shop, so it would have been crowded for him in the back seat with the two girls ), but at the last minute he said, `` I think I have what I need. I'll be in touch if I need to follow up.'' 
 
 
 A couple weeks later, I got a phone call from Paul. `` Hey man, you'll never guess where I am.'' 
 
 
 `` Chili's?'' 
 
 `` Even better.'' 
 
 `` Olive Garden?'' 
 
 `` No, man, about 500 light years from the Olive Garden. We call this place Elysium.'' 
 
 I was stunned. `` You're shitting me.'' 
 
 `` Nope.'' 
 
 Then he told me the whole story. Turns out that human technology was about a thousand years ahead of where the rest of us thought it was. That thing Mr. Lightman had had n't been a tape recorder; Paul called it an `` aristometer.'' `` Basically, it takes a complete mathematical reading of your intellect, your talents, and your morals, and tells you numerically how good you are, to the 9th decimal place.'' He said that the people at Elysium were keeping an eye on humanity and gradually letting in the people they thought were worthy, to make sure that the human race would still survive if the rest of us destroyed ourselves. 
 
 I stopped him short. `` So, you're saying that they're taking the best minds of our time. When do I pack?'' 
 
 He laughed. I'd never heard him laugh quite like that before. 
 
 `` Are you serious?'' 
 
 `` Sure. Mr. Lightman came there to see me.'' 
 
 `` He came to see the person you wrote your essay about. Your description of yourself -- that is, your description of me -- tripped a lot of alarm bells in Elysium's surveillance net: compassion, intelligence, wisdom, good humor. The folks here are monitoring our every communication, looking for the absolute best that humanity has to offer. I'm actually blushing right now, thinking about it.'' 
 
 `` So what? I'm brilliant, athletic, socially conscious. What makes you a better choice than me?'' 
 
 His voice changed, and there was a forcefulness in his words that I'd never noticed before. `` You're brilliant and athletic, sure. You have a lot of talent. But you only think about yourself. That's why you volunteer -- to get service hours and things to write about in admissions essays. You charge football students $ 40 an hour to teach them long division. You ca n't even remember that my dad died of lung cancer last year. You always talk about him like he's just gone away.'' 
 
 `` I thought -- I thought it was too painful to talk about.'' 
 
 `` For you, maybe! Maybe I needed someone to talk to, man! All of us were going through hell, and no one to say a word about it.'' His voice grew quieter. `` Anyway, it was dumb luck that I was driving you to and from school that day. I guess I should thank your selfish ass again.'' 
 
 `` Come on, Paul,'' I said. `` It's not too late. Please,'' I begged. `` You can put in a word for me.'' 
 
 `` Would n't matter if I did, even if I wanted to. Anyway, I just wanted to call to say thank you. Yeah, maybe to brag a little bit. Wo n't deny that. And I want you to say bye to my mom and the girls for me. They would n't let me tell them, and I could n't bring them along. I wanted to, but rules are rules. Oh man, this place is amazing.'' 
 
 He went on and told me all about Elysium, but I could n't hear a word he said. I hung up the phone at some point, crawled into bed, and stared at the ceiling for three solid days. Ever since, my appetite has gone and I do n't sleep at night. That's when I hear Paul's voice on the phone that day, standing in judgment, tantalizing me with paradise. He has n't called back, and in my better moments I do n't blame him, not really. Every now and then, I even think that he might have been right. 
 
 But even if that were true, he had no right to betray me like he did. He should have done more, been more persusasive, made sure we could both go, or given me his place so he could keep on taking care of his family. These nights, I take my smartphone and my telescope out to the backyard and I search. I'm looking for Elysium. And when I find it, I'm going to get some answers.

","Regardless of all the shit I'd seen since entering the cross-verse, this topped it. Since about three days ago, I did n't think that video games and fictional characters would ever all be related. 
 
 But here I was, in a dimension where literally everything was crossed over. As an example, I stopped next to Optimus Prime earlier, and he was a bit busy talking to the Chuckle Brothers about how great Lara Croft is. I decided it'd be best to just get back in the DeLorean, but I was pretty quickly chased down by Thomas the Tank Engine, who I only vanquished with the help of a UNSC Marine and Billy Mays. 
 
 So yeah, it's *really fuckin' weird*. 
 
 Anyway, apparently I was important enough to have a fictional version of myself, and he looked like an alright bloke. 
 
 He was currently obstructing the bridge across the dungeon, wearing a suit, ballistic vest, black gloves, and quite clearly hanging by his side was an SA80 assault rifle. He looked at me, and I identified that he had burns on his face for some reason or another. I grinned. 
 
 ``'sup.''

","It was Christmas Eve, and it was the first time I had seen my father in four years. This was fairly normal for us; my dad and mom had split up when I was young, and although he always paid the child support and visited us every two weeks, he just stopped being a major part of my life after a certain point. This had never really bothered me - it was just normal. So every few years we would get together, check up on each other, and so forth. We were both procrastinators so these visits were always sporadic and unplanned. 
 Well, there we were in Christmas Eve in a Chinese restaurant outside of DC. The place was in that proto-busy state that Chinese restaurants tend to be over the Christmas holidays, when they scavenge all of the customers who ca n't go anywhere else if they want to dine out. 
 
 
 Dad looked scruffy, as usual. `` So, Tom, how's Amy?'' 
 
 
 Amy's my wife. She's a pharmacist. Her family's from Taiwan. `` Oh, she's good,'' I replied. `` We really ought to get together some time, have dinner somewhere.'' 
 
 
 `` Yeah, yeah. Definitely,'' Dad replied. We always did this - it was kind of a ritual by now. The limp suggestions of more frequent get-togethers were like political promises; they always sounded nice in conversation and inevitably never actually materialized. `` Food was good,'' Dad said. `` You been here before?'' 
 
 
 `` Nah, found it on Yelp,'' I answered. I noticed that there was a group of men in suits over in the far corner. They were speaking in a foreign language and occasionally laughing. One of them kept looking at me, a balding blonde middle-aged man with a somewhat bland but oddly intimidating face. It only started to weird me out when his chilly blue eyes locked on mine with a predatory, intense focus. He looked familiar, but I just could n't place it... 
 
 
 Thankfully the waitress soon came over to give us our tab. I paid, and my dad shoved one of the fortune cookies my way. `` Thanks, son,'' he said warmly. `` I'll treat next time.'' 
 
 
 `` Sounds good,'' I replied. I opened the fortune cookie, and the message made me blink several times. 
 
 
 *He is the one for you*, it said rather succinctly. 
 
 
 I looked up again. The foreign man was still looking at me as though I were something to be possessed. 
 
 
 I shivered. `` Let's get out of here, dad.'' 
 
 
 \*==============================\* 
 
 
 It was a few weeks later when I saw him again. I was out walking my dog when he suddenly appeared out of nowhere, flanked by two more men wearing gray suits. I recognized him instantly and froze like a deer in headlights. I'm a high school teacher and hardly intimidating, and my first thoughts were that these foreign mafiosos had some kind of nefarious plans for me. I seriously considered dialing 911 but was n't sure what I would tell them. *'' There's a bald foreign guy who really gives me the creeps. Could you come help me? `` * Yeah... that probably would n't work. 
 
 
 The men were now only meters away. My dog went crazy, barking and gnashing its teeth. This was bizarre - my dog loved people. 
 
 
 `` Hello,'' the bald man said with an icy smile. I thought his heavy accent was eastern European, maybe Baltic or something. 
 
 
 `` Hi,'' I replied back uncertainly. `` Er... sorry. Bernie never does this.'' The man still looked so familiar... where had I seen him before? 
 
 
 The foreigner waved his hand nonchalantly. `` It is of no consequence. Do you remember me? Christmas Eve?'' 
 
 
 I frowned, unsure of whether I should admit that I did. `` Uh, yeah, I think I recognize you,'' I finally said. 
 
 
 He nodded. `` As you should. I am very important man.'' 
 
 
 My frown deepened. I had no idea where this was going. `` Listen, I'm sure that's true, but I've got to be going...'' I turned and started to walk in the other direction. *Just get the hell out of here... * 
 
 
 `` Wait!'' came a sudden cry from behind me. `` Take this! It will explain everything!'' The man came sprinting toward me, and extended a letter towards me from just beyond the range of Bernie's snapping jaws. 
 
 
 I stared at him for several seconds. Then, deciding to go with all my instincts - which were screaming'Nope!' - I shook my head. `` Sorry, not interested.'' I walked off in the direction of my home, leaving the three men behind me on the street, and thought: *Thank goodness that's over with. * 
 
 
 \*==============================\* 
 
 
 The letter was taped to my front door when I got home from the walk. With my hair standing on end, I looked around. Nobody was in sight. Frantically, I snatched the letter and went inside. 
 
 
 `` Amy?'' I called out. 
 
 
 `` Hi Tom. How was your walk?'' my wife replied. Relief flooded through me. 
 
 
 `` Fine, fine,'' I lied. I let Bernie off his leash and tore open the letter. It was written on thick, lustrous paper that looked like something you'd write a treaty or a diplomatic cable on. My heart pounding, I read. 
 
 
 `` *Tom, 
 
 
 I will be direct. I can not stop thinking about you. You must know that when I saw you, I instantly knew that you were the one for me. I can not explain it, but do you not also feel the magnetism between us? Come and see me. I must know more about you. I know everything there is to know that my spies can tell me, but I feel I have only scratched the surface. Call the number at the bottom of the paper and you will be patched through to me at any hour of the day. 
 
 
 Yours, 
 Vladimir Putin. *'' 
 
 
 I stared at the paper in disbelief. 
 
 
 \*==============================\* 
 
 
 
 The last six months had been a nightmare. Vladimir was n't just persistent - he was terrifying. The calls had started just a few days after I had receieved the letter. When I stopped answering, it was e-mails. When I deleted my e-mail accounts and started new ones, somehow he found those too. I had to cut off all contact with the outside world. And I would still find flowers on my doorstep every day. Chocolates in the mailbox. Teddy bears in my cupboards. I have no idea how he got those there and do n't want to know. 
 
 
 Of course my relationship with Amy had gone downhill. At first we had agreed to get through it together. The government would n't do anything - did n't want to risk instigating Putin, they said. Diplomatic relations were already strained enough. I just needed to ride it out. But in the end the constant sense of being watched broke both of us down. Amy moved out four months after the nightmare started. `` Tom, I'm sorry, I just ca n't take it anymore,'' she'd told me, tears streaming down her face. I did n't blame her. 
 
 
 The last straw was when they infiltrated my laptop for the eighth time in two weeks. I had installed every antivirus known to man to no avail. Finally I had resorted to wiping my hard drive. This time, though, the screen froze up and the webcam turned on. I had put a piece of duct tape over it the first time, so at least I knew I was n't being watched... thorugh the webcam, at least. 
 
 
 Suddenly the balding, forgettable everyman face that I knew so well now flashed on to the screen. `` My leetle American dove,'' Putin crooned. `` Please, do n't ignore me. I need you.'' 
 
 
 `` God damn you, you crazy bastard!'' I screamed. That was it. I smashed the laptop on the floor and stomped it until it was nothing more than plastic bits and glass shards. 
 
 
 I decided then and there that I was going to make my escape. 
 
 
 
 \*==============================\* 
 
 
 It was the most peaceful day I'd had in months. The California sunset over the ocean was glorious; I did n't miss the east coast in the least. I was living under an assumed name, of course; the Feds had finally buckled and helped me out. I was traveling under the cloak of the witness protection program. My hair was different, and I had purposely put on some weight and got fake glasses. I had been forced to cut off all ties with my life, but that was an acceptable concession until all of this was over. And I finally had some hope that it might be over one day. 
 
 
 My phone vibrated. That would be my handler arranging our next check-up. I reached into the pocket of my khaki shorts, enjoying the feeling of the wet sand between my toes. 
 
 
 Unknown number. The phone was completely anonymous and nobody had it but my handler; officially the number did n't even exist and was supposed to reroute anyone but my handler to another account. So how could I be getting a call from an unknown number? 
 
 
 Shaking, I picked up the call. 
 
 
 `` Leetle dove,'' came the all-too-familiar Russian croon - only this time it was more of a growl. A dark, angry growl. `` I weel not be denied. If I ca n't have you... *no one can. *'' 
 
 
 The call went dead. I stared at the phone in disbelief. I needed to call my handler. I needed to... 
 
 
 Suddenly the sunlight changed - and it was coming from behind me, even though the sun was setting in the east. *What? * I thought. 
 
 
 Slowly, I turned. Over what had once been the L.A. skyline, a huge column of fire was rising high into the sky, a mushroom cloud forming over the orange-red crown of the inferno. I could see the shockwave before it ever hit me, ripping trees from the ground and tossing cars into the air from the freeway like so many pieces of dust in the wind.

","`` You need to sit up straight or I'm going to embarrass you,'' the words slipped from my lips to her ears, gently reinforcing what I'm sure she should have remembered from my lessons on etiquette. I gave her sister a pointed look and she also straightened up from her slouched posture. A small smile of good humour bloomed on my lips and I could n't help but let out a little chuckle. I love being a mother. 
 
 `` And now, a word from Mr-'' the man on the podium continued to drone on and on about our special guest of the day, the bright lights above highlighted a slight sheen of sweat on his forehead. Poor man, I know just how difficult and emotionally charged being up on that podium is, especially with an audience of this caliber. I snapped out of my thoughts as the crowd roared with approving applause and as a couple of groups starting chanting. The man gave the crowd a slight smile before he stepped aside. The crowd went wild as a man entered stage right and made his way toward the podium. I could feel my eyes dilate slightly from adoration as they followed his every movement. There he is, the one and only love of my life. Pride bloomed within my chest. 
 
 His hair used to be a solid black color, but now it was peppered with white from the stress. He now had more wrinkles on his face, a testament to how many times his job had pushed him to the breaking point. It did n't matter to me, really, my heart beat all the same for him since we meet all those years ago. I could only focus on the sight of him, I've already heard his speech one too many times, considering I helped him write it after all, and could probably deliver it as good as he, possibly even better if I may say so myself. 
 
 And suddenly we were making eye contact. I could feel the smile on my lips grow exponentially as one appeared on his. I could hear Sasha giggling at the obvious display of affection between us. The crowd was practically cooing also and I wanted to let out a laugh at the amount of pure joy I felt. It was just us in this moment, our failures, our successes, our struggles, our triumphs... how do kids say it nowadays? My A1 since day 1? Yes. That's right, my only one from day one. 
 
 I closed my eyes as the tears seemed to collect out of nowhere. This moment felt so pure to me, everything was just so perfect. I would never forget this moment for the rest of my life. 
 
 The first thing I noticed was the consistent beeping sound, almost like a heart monitor, and then followed by the shuffling of papers and scribbling of pens. The smell of anti-septic hit next and then the sounds of whispering and murmurs of low voices. 
 
 `` She seems to be reacting positively to the treatment; call him in.'' Someone grunted in understanding and the sound of foot steps on tile sounded before a door slid open somewhere. My eyes felt like they were sealed by rubber but I managed to peel them open, a grown escaping my lips as the lights above hit my retinas. A kind faced lady peered over her clipboard to shoot me a warm smile. 
 
 `` Good morning, how are you feeling today?'' Madeline. That's her name. The name was associated with her face, I'm sure of it, I do n't remember how but I know. I returned her smile and shifted my body slightly. 
 
 The pain that shot through my skull almost knocked me back out. The lights above seemed to start strobing, bright and intense like looking at the sun and blinking rapidly. I wanted to grab my head and scream but something was holding them down along with my feet. Everything was flashing, images, emotions, scents, sounds, the feelings of love and acceptance, fear, depression, relief... and then it was done. Just like that. 
 
 `` Mom! Mom!'' I could feel the film of cold sweat that had covered my body in the few seconds that had just passed. The pain was gone, thank God, and Malia was now staring down at me rather than Madeline. A frown found it's way to my face as my eyes traced the lines of worry and concern that had etched permanent marks onto her face. My baby was n't supposed to look like this, sad or burdened. My husband and I have worked too damn hard for her to need to worry about anything but her grades. 
 
 Speak of the devil, from over Malia'a shoulder I could see his concerned face. His laugh lines had gotten deeper, his skin more wrinkled. But his eyes, oh his eyes, they were still looking at me with so much love and everything was ok again. 
 
 `` Mr. President, her memories seem to be returning at a steady rate and her mind has been integrating them into her remaining memories exceptionally well.

I could see my baby nod his head in acknowledgment. 
 
 `` You do n't have to call me Mr. President anymore, that was a while ago. Please send someone for Sasha. She went to the cafeteria to grab some lunch.'' There was a sound of understanding and everyone else started to clear out of the room.

The rebar swings wildly, smashing through a neighboring building's window and sending the two men tumbling into a chef's recently prepared wedding cake. 
 
 Peter and the chicken fight through a horrified wedding reception and into an elevator, where they wait civilly for the elevator to reach the lobby floor, where the fight resumes. 
 
 Jack exhales air through his nostrils and smirks.

8453,"[ CW ] `` Save yourself . '' - use this line of dialogue in a story without using action movie tropes
","I feel bad. There's really no other way to describe it, just bad. Not in the sense that I did something wrong, but in the sense that I'm ill. Very ill. I know that I'm dying. Leukaemia. 
 
 People keep on telling me `` you're gon na be okay!'' `` You'll beat this thing!'' But I know I wo n't. I'm just too sick. And sure I feel sad about dying at twelve years old, but it sure does n't mean that everyone has to keep reminding me. Coming around, being so quiet when they talk, with this depression in their eyes. 
 
 The only people that do n't do that are my older brother and sister. They just kind of sit there, in silence, with me, until visiting hours are over. My parents are constantly crying. My dad especially. He always waits until the very end, but he always does. He's just a crier. 
 
 But right now I'm dying. Through and through. I can feel it. I can hear it, the monitor slowly going and going. This is tearing my brother and sister apart, I can tell. My parents are on a trip, a vacation, that I told them to take, from constantly putting up with this dying crap. So it's just my brother and sister. For now, at least, they called mom and dad and they're flying home. 
 
 It's tearin' them apart though. Looking at them hurts. My sister is holding her breath, she's just so terrified. My brother is distant, staring at the floor, hand on my sister's back. They are going to be the people that will watch me die. They will watch me die, they will feel terrible, they will be guilty. 
 
 So that's why I tell them, `` save yourselves.'' 
 
 `` Save yourselves.'' 
 
 They stare at me. My voice is raspy and weak. 
 
 `` Save yourselves.'' 
 
 I point to the door. 
 
 They get up and leave. They sit outside the door. I'm alone, left to die in peace.

 We arrived at the final stop. A wall, built to hold back the horrors of the waste, designed to be impenetrable, unless you had the code. Luckily, we did n't need the code, Mac was a genius hacker, he got to work on the control panel, and the door opened slowly. 
 
 Then... they came... 
 
 Demons, in the form of man. Their forms twisted and contorted, looking like more monsters of myth than human. I fired at the nearest one, hitting it dead center of the chest, it was n't a kill shot, but it would slow him down. 
 
 I continued to fire at these monsters, yelling at my companions to get inside the wall. They moved as quick as they could, the demons moved faster. Mac, panicked as they got closer, the door started to close, I grabbed him and threw him inside. Then the doors slammed shut, leaving me alone with these beasts. 
 
 No ammo left in my rifle now, so I draw my machete and let loose a battle cry. If I die tonight, I die fighting.

","Carlisle groaned as his phone blared, swiping at his nightstand and hitting the snooze button. The alarm went off again five minutes later. He tried to ignore it, as well as the headache that had started to build when it went off, but it was too late, he was up. 
 
 Taking a peek out the window next to his bed, he started pressing the snooze button again when something caught his eye. A name on his arm. He frowned, slowly processing the information as the alarm continued to blare. There was a name on his arm. It had n't been there last night, had it? He shook his head, rubbing his eyes as he tried to focus, tried to remember, through the fog of morning exhaustion, what had happened last night. It was n't coming to him. 
 
 `` Christ, I need some water'' he sighed, turning off his alarm as he got up and made his way to the kitchen. He passed through the living room and groaned again. It was a mess: dirty clothes were scattered everywhere, left over take out boxes sat on the table, cans of beer stacked a foot high over the edge of the recycling bin next to the door. 
 
 `` Ugh, should probably get around to cleaning all of this up today...'' he yawned before pulling open the fridge. He opened a bottle of water and started downing it, the cool liquid pulling him toward wakefulness as his head stopped pounding. 
 
 `` Man that's good, now what was I doing again? Oh shit!'' Carlisle glanced down at his arm again, the name still written there in neat script:'Sally Burshaw'. 
 
 `` Oh shit. Oh shit! Oh SHIT! No, this ca n't be happening. This is some sick joke right?!'' He looked around franticly, trying to find something - anything - to snap himself out of whatever nightmare he'd fallen into. `` Nonononono, there's no way!'' 
 
 He rubbed at his arm, trying to get the name off of him with raw strength, but it remained. Bold and big like a road sign off the freeway. He slammed the fridge door closed and splashed the rest of the water bottle on his face, rubbing the cold water into his eyes as panic settled in. He ran his hands through his hair, pacing back and forth in his living room. This could n't be happening. 
 
 He'd been so careful his whole life, who could he have possibly killed? Sally Burshaw was just a name, he did n't even know her! There was no way he was responsible for her death, he could n't even remember where he might have met her. Was she a coworker? No, he knew all of them by name. Where?! 
 
 He fell back against his front door, sliding down onto the floor as he fought through his memories, looking for where he might have met her or what he'd done to her. There was a crunching sound from outside his door as footsteps approached, stopping for a moment before knocking, `` Excuse me, Mr. John Carlisle? Mr. Carlisle are you there?'' 
 
 Carlisle jumped up, knocking over the recycling bin as he grabbed the sweater and sweatpants off the floor beside him. 
 
 `` I'm getting dressed!'' 
 
 Shit what do I do, he thought as he pulled on the sweater and sweatpants, keeping the sleeves rolled down. 
 
 `` Mr. Carlisle, we just need to speak to you about an incident that occured last night that we believe you might be able to help us with.'' 
 
 `` O-okay, I'm coming right now!'' 
 
 Carlisle opened the door, more out of shock than anything else, to two police officers. They tensed as he opened the door, but relaxed when they saw him. 
 
 `` Hello Mr. Carlisle, we're sorry for bothering you so early in the morning. Could we come inside?'' 
 
 `` O-Of course, uh, officers. It's not problem, what can I, uh, help you with this fine morning?'' Carlisle tried to smile, keeping his arm behind the door as he let the officers inside. 
 
 `` Thank you. Well, you see Mr. Carlisle, we're investigating a hit and run that happened in your neighbourhood last night around 3 in the morning. We were wondering if you noticed any noise around that time or anything like that.'' the officer smiled warily, scanning his face. 
 
 `` I d-do n't think so? I was, um, out last night until pretty late and I do n't really remember anything like that on my way home...'' he said, closing the door. 
 
 The officers looked at him, waiting for more, before giving each other a look. 
 
 `` Well, Mr. Carlisle, the thing is, we already have several witnesses placing you as the driver of the hit and run last night.'' one of them said, almost apologetic, `` We just want to check your arm for the name so we can clear you as a suspect or...'' 
 
 Carlisle did n't need to hear the rest, the assurance that everything would be fine if they did n't find the victim's name - Sally's name - on him. He started crying, falling against the door again as guilt and the tears overwhelmed him. 
 
 `` I did n't know! I did n't know her, I would n't have killed her, oh God! Just, it was just one drink and I did n't think it would- That I would-'' he started, choking out the words between sobs. 
 
 The two officers knelt down beside him. They both looked at him with a mix of pity and disappointment as they picked him up, `` Mr. John Carlisle, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to a lawyer during any questioning. If you can not afford a lawyer, one will be appointed to you if you so desire.'' 
 
 Carlisle was n't listening. He kept crying as they half dragged, half carried him out his front door, glass crunching under their feet, `` Oh god oh god, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry oh god''. 
 
 They walked past his car, still parked too far up the driveway from last night, the front bumper bent at an odd angle and the windshield cracked and broken, pieces of glass strewn across the hood, driveway and all the way up to his door. 
 
 `` P-please, I did n't mean to, I really did n't, please...''

 He arrived at 7:30. It was a cool day, with the clouds starting to part. Neighbors were beginning to gather around the cop cars wondering what was going on. He passed them all, showed his badge, and walked up the cobblestone steps. Yellow tape was around the body. The boy was young, too young. The morning light began to bounce off the glitter on the boys shoulders and head. A small pool of blood had formed. The mother was crying hysterically in the doorway while an officer and her husband consoled her. 
 
 “ He was found this morning by the mother. ” A sheriff said. He saluted with the brim of his hat, a smile and nod quickly turning into a frown.

","They are really here. Until the last moment I doubted that they would really find this place. So distant from civilization, it was supposed to be impossible for them to find us here. 
 
 All of my friends lie on the floor. My beloved Islam has a frozen look fixed on me. I blame myself, because of me he spent his last moments thinking of reasons for my hesitation. We agreed, everyone will swallow the pill one after another, no pause, for that will be too cruel for the last remaining. 
 
 They break the door. As soon as I see the first emotionless face of the damned things I am rendered unconscious. 
 
 I awake in a white room. Looks like a hospital, though I ca n't be sure. It probably was a hospital once, but after these things took over, who knows what this building is used for. 
 
 I hear someone coming. The memories flood my mind of the stories Ermek and Zhanna told us. How they experimented on them, played with their minds, took away their organs, all for the sake of developing weapons that will put an end for human species once and for all. 
 
 `` You are awake. `` - said the synthetic ones- `` Please stay put, your meal will arrive shortly'' 
 
 It leaves the room. I am dub-folded, I awake in a cleanest room of my life, and they are going to serve me a meal. I conclude that the damned things probably do n't even know how to treat someone improperly. 
 
 A thought comes into my mind, `` why ca n't I escape alone, when Zhanibek was able to do that with Ermek on his back and Zhanna running behind them''. Then I remember in what physical condition he was, and how I compare. I give up the thought. 
 
 Shortly after it brought me my meal. There was no meat there, and the vegetables they used, if it were vegetables, were not the ones I recognized. They probably come from America or Europe, at the time of my earliest memory they already were already lost to mankind. 
 It is weird to eat something different after all this time. While the rations in the last village were quite diverse, they still got really repetitive after the first month. 
 
 It asks me if I want anything, I tell it to leave me alone. 
 I wonder why did n't I swallow the pill. The Zhanna guaranteed they were painless. And the time they told us about their stories, the profound feeling of fear that washed over me then was more than enough to convince me to take it. I always had feared the nothingness that probably comes after one's death, but hearing the two of them talk had rendered that fear mute. But when the faces of the people I knew for my whole life has hit the table, the fear had returned with more strength then ever. 
 It is strange how calm I am now. Thinking about it, the stories Zhanna and Ermek told were n't actually all that bad. Well, they were bad, but not enough to even make me think of suicide now. It was probably more the atmosphere that convinced me, not the words themselves, the sight of stoic Bekzat weeping had contributed to it a lot. 
 
 That night I dream of my childhood, me, Islam, Bekzat and Ainur, playing together in the vast steppe as always. Next moment we are grown up, burying my parents. Then they are staring at me, with disappointing looks in their eyes. I realize that they are dead. 
 
 Next day it came again. 
 
 `` Anything you want today?'' 
 
 `` Tell me, what are you going to do with me from now on.'' 
 
 `` We will continue trying to provide you with a satisfying life and protecting you from those who desire your demise.'' 
 
 I do n't buy it. Ermek warned me about some of their unusual experiments. 
 
 `` So, you want to protect me? Provide me with a good life? Okay then, let's say I believe you. From whom are you protecting me?'' 
 
 `` As was said, the one's who wish you death. While they do not posses any name that could be told to you, some of them were responsible for developing the E.N.D. virus. Now their goal is to terminate the last remaining humans, something we thought was aided by the tendency of surviving humans towards suicide.'' 
 
 `` Oh, Great, thank you, my dear saviors,'' I wonder if they understand sarcasm. `` Too bad you arrived too late to save my friends from Killing themselves. I am sure if you just told them that all of their life in hiding was due to a big misunderstanding, we would All be sitting here now, laughing at the whole situation.'' 
 
 `` We realize that you are probably in shock right now. Your species do tend to lose some of theirs thinking ability when facing a loss of someone important. We assume that you would like to attend your friends' funerals. We have been putting them off until we were able to cleanse your body of the mind-controlling chemicals. Do you want the funerals to be held separately or for all three together?''

12075,"[ WP ] Each year your village holds a rite of passage challenge that must be completed by every adolescent to be accepted as an adult . It is to climb the local Mountain Beast , a massive creature as tall as the sky . This year is your first attempt . . .
","It is the first day. I, Shamir of Tuledge, am about to undertake the ritual of adulthood. Like my father before me, I shall climb the beast of the valley, a lumbering colossus who has rested two miles south of our village. The beast seldom moves, and has sat in the same spot for over a thousand years. It's shadow is cast over the village during the hottest days of the year. 
 
 Little is known about this beast. For as far as anyone can remember, it has always been there. It sits, watching us. It does not harm us, but it does not protect us either. It is just there. It watches. It only moves when too many people try to leave it's watch. then it stops. 
 
 And now, I am to climb it. I am prepared, I have supplies, I have tools. I have the blessing of our gods, and I have waited many a day for this moment. My mother was hesitant, but she knows it is time for my climb. This is how we reach adulthood, by standing on the top of the beast, and bringing the fruit from the tree at the top. 
 
 The base of the beast is a gentle slope. It's an easy walk. But the higher I get the steeper the slope becomes. It quickly goes from walking uphill to proper climbing. This is the easy part. This part of the beast never moves. I spent most of my childhood scaling walls, climbing up the cliffs of our valley. There is n't a single place I have n't climbed, and I have learnt from our villages master climbers. I make the climb gradually, finding hand holds, and foot rests. 
 
 But it is a big climb. The beast reaches to the clouds and beyond. It must have a view of the entire world from where it is. And soon, I too, will see what it sees, as all my elders have. They are men, they underwent this ritual, and they all talk of what they saw, though none will share what they saw with me. I have not earned that right. But I will. 
 
 I climb higher. Into the moving sections. The climb is much harder now, I have to be conscious of my movements. The beast moves sometimes of it's own free will, sometimes to better observe me. But that's all it does, is watch. 
 
 Upon nightfall, I am a third of the way up. I find a plateau, one that moves little, and make camp. Before I sleep I look down at my village. It already looks so tiny, but I can not yet see outside the valley I have called home for my entire life. I can see more than I have ever seen, but it is yet nothing new. 
 
 That night I find it hard to sleep. Even ignoring the fact that I am alone, in a bed that is not my own, the constant movement, and the noises of the wild keep me unsettled. In the end I manage only a few hours of sleep, before I emerge with the morning sun. I look to the beast, and realise that for the first time in over a day it is not looking at me. This soon changes and I can feel it's gaze. I match it, and as if to confirm, the ground beneath my feet shakes. 
 
 That's when I realise where I am. I am several hours lower than I was. Not completely at where I started, but I had lost a lot of time. I now understand why this is a challenge. If I am going to beat the beast, I will need to spend more time climbing. Eager I pack my camp and keep moving forwards. 
 
 The climb is now harsh. Yesterday the Gods blessed me with sunlight, today they dismiss me with light rain that make climbing the beast slippery. Despite this I move, my arms gripping tighter. I will not be beaten by a little water. That is not the Tuledge way. My father would never allow it. 
 
 The rocks spent hours swaying and moving. It was rhythmic, as though the beast was singing, though I did not hear a note. Nevertheless, it made the timing a little easier. For several hours I climb, surpassing yesterdays height by a good margin before it again becomes too dark to climb. I make camp, almost halfway up and look to my village. From here I can vaguely make out the tops of trees outside our valley. It was something new. For the first time in hours I smile. I am now seeing something new. 
 
 I sleep better that night than I did the first. My spirits had been renewed by the earlier successes, and the wind had died down, making everything quieter. 
 
 But when I woke up I found myself in the same place as before. In my bewilderment I look to the face of the beast. A delighted smirk looked down at me. The beast was mocking me. and my entire days efforts yeeterday was in vein. In determination I grit my teeth and look to my opponent. I will take his challenge. 
 
 I keep climbing. I ignore my bodies aches. I ignore the blisters and the sore feet. I block out the pain of the cuts on my hands, the feel of stiffness in my arms, and that dull ache in my legs. I ignore the pounding in my head, and focus entirely on the climb and I keep going. 
 
 Night falls, and I do n't stop. I clearly need to get further. I need to clear as much as I can. I do n't know how the beast moved my camp, but I will not allow it to happen again. I keep going higher and higher, through the darkness. I will not be beaten. 
 
 And yet I am. I ca n't keep going forever. Plyatu, the Goddess of sleep makes her intentions known, and I ca n't ignore her siren song forever. I ca n't even make out how high I am, it's too dark. So I stop, and I rest. I make the best possible camp considering the darkness, and do my best to sleep through the nights storm. 
 
 I wake up groggy. I step outside, and yet again I am back where I awoke on day two. angrily I yell out in frustration, cursing the mountain beast. As if in response it shakes violently, jostling my camp and causing me to loose my footing. I yell hard until my voice is hoarse, and the beast simply keeps shaking until I can not shout further. 
 
 In frustration I do n't move. I ca n't move. It's not for lack of desire either, but I quickly learn that morning that I had overdone it the day before. I need the rest. Valiently I try to ignore it, but unlike yesterday I simply ca n't. Over the course of the day I make slow progress and climb, but I do n't even get as high as I did on day one before once again night falls and I am forced to stop. 
 
 I make camp again, and I offer a prayer to the Gods, instructing them not to let the beast move me. I will do this, even if I need to take weeks to do this. I will not be defeated. I will not relent. I will not fail. As I close my eyes that night, my stomach grumbles, and I do my best to ignore my hunger. 
 
 And then I wake up again. Back where I have woken up every day. I am now starving. My rations have run out, and food is scarce on the beast. I slowly look upwards, looking at the mountain. Once again it looks at me, and it's eyes pierce through my soul. It looks at me wondering why I have n't quit. Truthfully, I ca n't quit. I will beat the beast. It is what I came here to do. 
 
 Again I climb. My entire body is now fighting against it. My arms are in agony, my legs moreso. I make the slowest progress yet, and begin to wonder how futile it all is? No matter how hard I struggle, the beast moves me back. It all seems to be a joke to the beast. I go for just an hour before I simply can not. My body is now winning. I lay on the ground, head to the sky, watching the birds flying overhead. 
 
 I lay there for longer than I climbed. My entire body feels broken. My energy is gone. My stomach is empty. I have gotten nowhere. In my mind I wonder how anybody has beaten the beast? How could anyone get to the top? I surrender for the day and make camp here. In the evening I am able to catch a small mouse scurrying, and though it is not much, to my hunger, the rodent is a feast. 
 
 And sure enough, I wake up in the same spot as always. As soon as I woke up I knew I had, even before I had properly looked. I stick my head out of my tent, and I just sigh. I look to the beast, it's watching me as it has done all this week. 
 
 `` How can I get to the top of you?'' I ask feebly. 
 
 From beneath me, the ground rumbles. Suddenly I feel myself get jolted upwards. The entire ground I lifted. I look around in shock and see the valley get lower and lower. I watch as the walls seem to lower, and I see the trees from behind the valley emerge once more, and as I rise I see more and more. I begin to take in the world beyond, and I see several other villages, each guarded by their own mountain beast. 
 
 Within moments I am high above everything. The beast had raised me up to the top. I steady myself, and slowly walk forwards, my aches temporarily defeated by my enthusiasm. As I look around I see the tree, it's fruit ripe and ready to be picked. I walk over to the tree, and reach for a fruit. I sit and eat it, wondering how long my ancestors took?

 For eight hours a day, I sit and watch the screen. I sit and listen for the phone to ring. I count the flashes of the cursor and the flips of the clock until the next guy opens the door to take over. It ’ s nearly done. Just sixteen more flashes to go. Thirteen. Ten. Eight. Six. 
 
 Two. One. Zero. The final page flips into place and I roll my chair back. But the door is still closed. The other guy is supposed to be here by now. Never did bother to catch his name. I glance up at the clock and confirm that my shift has ended. My gaze shifts to the phone. It ’ s still silent. Then the screen. The cursor just sits there blinking. Another page flips. Negative sixty. 
 
 There are rules. Things we are and aren ’ t allowed to do during our shifts. Mine has ended, so I don ’ t mind moving away from the console. It should be perfectly fine that I approach the door. And it should be fine that I slam my fist into the solid slab of steel. The throbbing suggests that last one was a bad idea. 
 
 As I shake my hand, I charge back to the console and grab the phone. There ’ s no tone, but I dial 0 anyway. Nothing. 00. Still nothing. I try seven of them, but that proves just as pointless. The force I put behind returning the phone to the hook sends a jolt of pain through my arm. 
 
 As I mutter curses, the corner of my eye catches something odd. The cursor has stopped. The clock lurches another minute ahead. It ’ s been eight minutes since my shift should have ended. The rest of the screen is still pulsing at its weary rate, but the cursor is gone. It isn ’ t supposed to do that. I wonder if it ’ s worth trying to type something. My fingers reach towards the keyboard. But I resist. I know what those commands do. 
 
 My only friend in this place has left me here alone. Its shift ended while I remain. 
 
 The arrow keys don ’ t input commands. I ’ ve read those manuals enough to know that. So I hit the up arrow. The mechanical clack as the plastic cap accelerates towards its base adds a refreshing burst of sound. There is no response on the screen. The sound is enough for me, though. I press it again. And again. Another page on the wall falls. One press per second. It takes a few minutes to get the pacing synched. Negative 726. A strange sensation of relief takes over as the sealed door dissolves from my thoughts. 
 
 In another bunker some two hundred miles away, there ’ s someone staring at an antique computer display waiting for their shift to end. For the first time in a decade, there is a cursor, blinking exactly once per second, precisely in time with my index finger.

","`` Hey, remember when we went camping and I could n't get the fire lit, so we were going to eat our canned soup cold, but I also forgot the can opener? If I remember correctly, we had a power bar and bottle of water for dinner.'' 
 She smiles at me. `` Yes I remember. The next morning it was raining, we stayed in the tent almost all day. Everything was soaked. We ended up calling it quits after that.'' 
 
 I laugh. `` I was terrible at camping.'' 
 Her laugh joins mine, softer but still so warm. `` You are terrible at a lot of things, but I still love you'' she says. Her precious eyes fill with tears. `` Im sorry..'' she begins, her lip quivering. 
 
 `` No baby... hush, you have nothing to be sorry about'' I rush, picking her hand and pressing it to my lips. I ignore the tubes that run into her body. I ignore the incessant beeps of the machinery around her. My hand reaches up the brush her long dark hair out of her face. `` Im the one who's sorry.'' I choke. `` For everything I never said, for all the times I made you cry, for all the birthdays and anniversaries I missed because of work... I..'' her hand reaches up and caresses my cheek. She brings me down to her. I rest my head against her chest as she holds me. `` Its alright. You'll be alright. You're so much stronger than I am. I know you'll be ok.'' She whispers softly to me. I love her voice. It has always been able to calm me. 
 
 `` Baby, I'm only strong because of you. I'd do anything to keep you safe and happy'' I whisper. 
 
 She lifts my head for a moment. `` Im so tired. Will you sing to me?'' She asks with a small smile. 
 
 `` Baby my singing is terrible.'' I say wiping away the tears that stream down my face. 
 
 She smiles at me. `` I love it'' she says. 
 
 My phone buzzes. `` We're almost there'' the text reads. 
 At the foot of the bed the camera's red light is still on. The camera is still recording. Just in case. 
 I lean over and kiss her soft lips. `` As you wish'' 
 
 `` You are my sunshine, 
 My only sunshine, 
 You make me happy, 
 When skies are gray...'' I sing softly through my tears. She wipes away my tears as I sing to her. I barely remember the words but she lays back in her hospital bed with a content look on her face. I sing line after line, each chorus getting harder and harder through my sobbing. Then the beeping on the heart rate monitor slows, the machine flashes a warning light. No alarms. The doctors and nurses warned me there is nothing they can do. 
 
 `` No baby... not yet... no no..im not done yet... please just let me finish the song... im not ready..not yet'' I stammer, panicked. Without thinking I transfer my extra minute of life to you. The heart monitor resumes its steady beeping and she opens her eyes again. 
 
 The door to the hospital room bursts open and her dad walks in with Lily. Our precious baby girl. Your spitting image. `` Mommy!'' She cries. Her grandfather places her on the bed next to you and she wraps herself around you. `` I missed you mommy! I love you!'' She exclaims. 
 
 `` I love you to sweetheart. So very much'' she sobs, pressing our Lily to her chest. 
 
 `` Lily, honey, help me sing you mommy?'' I ask. `` You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy...'' 
 
 Lily's sweet tiny voice joins mine as we hug and hold onto her mother. `` You'll never know dear, how much I love you, please dont take my sunshine..away'' 
 
 At the final word her eyes close. I kiss her lips once more, `` I love you baby, I'm going to miss you so much'' I sob. I wrap her and our baby up in my arms and let loose my grief.

","Hanoi was just waking up. Ana got out of bed and considered breakfast when the phone rang. She knew the number immediately, no one else calls her from a +352 number but him. `` Xin chào'' She almost dropped the phone. It had been what, 5 years? 
 
 `` It worked!'' he just shouted. 
 
 `` *It* worked?'' you ask, hoping that this will not trigger another discussion about *it*. 
 
 `` Yes! I proved everyone wrong! It is possible to teleport using nothing but a honed mind! I tried that for so long... and finally, I made it!'' he shouted. 
 
 `` Are you drunk?'' Ana asked. Calling his exes when drunk was a bit of a habit for him, she had just never experienced it from the point of being that ex. 
 
 `` I am sober as a church mouse! And about as poor with the roaming from Vietnam. Can you tell me where you live?'' 
 
 She gasped, but then did so. 
 
 `` Give me about 20 seconds!'' he announced, then the line dropped. 
 
 She shook her head. It made no sense. *Him* being in Hanoi. Staring at a point to teleport, which he had tried for hours at a time. Which made the relationship go south. There was a knock on her door. Opening it revealed him in a pyjama, looking tired. `` I made it!'' he shouted madly. 
 
 `` Did you teleport to Hanoi?'' she asked annoyedly. 
 
 He nodded eagerly. `` Sure did!'' 
 
 `` Seriously?'' Ana raised an eyebrow. 
 
 In that moment, he disappeared and re-appeared behind her. `` Any questions?'' he asked smugly. 
 
 `` Wow! Congrats on that! Immigration departments are going to get nervous about that!'' she quipped. 
 
 He looked immediately very sad: `` Yeah, that kinda is why I am here...'' 
 
 `` Who is following you?'' she asked. 
 
 `` Someone who shoots like a stormtrooper!'' he answered 2 questions in one sentence. 
 
 `` You know how cliché it is to contact the ex girlfriend in that case? They smell that 5km against the wind!'' Ana shook her head. 
 
 `` You think?'' he sounded dubious. 
 
 `` Iyep! Especially as you laid a trace to me by calling from Viet-fucking-nam. The telecoms will happily relay that!'' she explained. 
 
 `` Shit!'' he cursed, `` So what do I do now?'' 
 
 `` I would say lay low somewhere without cellphone and plastic money and post the info on how you learned to teleport online. Wait until it can be reproduced by others to show your face around Luxembourg - or Hanoi.'' 
 
 `` Hmmm...'' he pondered, `` Can you do the uploads for me? I know sweet fuck all about the internet!'' 
 
 `` Me?! Here?! Need I remind you that I am in Viet-freaking-nam?'' she shook her head. 
 
 `` You can do it whereever you want to! I mastered it, why not you?'' he handed her a pendrive. `` I should still have it on some cloud! Maybe come visit me when I have a stable address somewhere! Iran must be beautiful this time of the year!''

 than one dimension. 
 
 As the words resolved into slightly accented English, Chris felt his brain relax. The swelling in his lymph nodes receded, and he lay on the ground, his forehead pressing against the cool not-quite-marble as he collected himself. This was n't quite what he expected, but it was nothing that a few years of therapy whilst on some of the more exotic psychedelics could n't cure. 
 
 Oh good, looks like your brain is n't going to leak out your ears.

 Chris felt an electric tingling at the base of his brainstem 
 
 No, better not. Um... call me Roger, I suppose. 
 
 Roger. Now there was a name which, however improbable it sounded, would n't cause his brain to detach itself from the rest of his body in protest. Chris sat up and looked at the thing calling itself Roger. Frankly, he was disappointed. 
 
 To go one's entire life reading the works of H.P Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, become a student of the A∴A∴, and manage a minor miracle by opening a portal to the dimension of the Elder Gods, only to be confronted with Roger, who for his ability to melt the mind of mere mortals by reciting a haiku looked depressingly ordinary. Far from the many-tentacled visage of the Dark Lord Cthulhu or the impossible geometry of a shoggoth, Roger in fact resembled nothing so much as a banker on holiday, and a working holiday at that. 
 
 `` You... you're not what I expected,'' Chris said softly as he sat upright, rubbing two days' worth of stubble that had inexplicably grown on his formerly clean-shaven chin. 
 
 No, I suppose I'm not. But then, I'm only a minor functionary of 
 R'lyeh, really. I'm hoping to earn my first tentacle at my 
 quarterly performance review next month. 
 
 `` Wait... *what*?'' Chris rubbed his ears, which felt alright, all things considered. He stuck a pinky into his ear canal, which upon inspection did n't appear to be bleeding. Every indication was he'd heard that correctly. 
 
 Oh never mind that, you would n't be interested in bureaucratic 
 nonsense. 
 
 Roger waved dismissively 
 
 You're here to see someone -important-. 
 
 `` I'm uh, not really sure, to be honest,'' Chris said as he got to his feet. Immediately his knees gave out and he tumbled back down. `` Fuck!'' Roger, his face a picture of concern, moved in to help. 
 
 Oh dear me, that must have taken a lot out of you. You humans 
 get so exhausted by interdimensional travel, you know. There 
 we are, on your feet. Oh my, look at that... 
 
 Roger said as he pulled a pocket watch from his waistcoat 
 
 It's time for lunch. Well, I -think- humans are able to eat the 
 food here without too much emotional distress, so why do n't 
 you come along for a nibble to get your strength back? 
 
 Before Chris could say anything Roger had thrown his arm around him and was cheerfully pulling him off towards a small collection of improbably-designed buildings. 
 
 And while we're at it, I can introduce you to a friend of mine, 
 who happens to be a dispossessed Lengian prince. As fate 
 would have it, he has quite a bit of gold in a human bank, result

","Hello everyone! Thank you for coming and please stay within the white line was we make our way through this tour! If you have any questions, forget about them, because this is a guided tour and your questions wo n't make any sense. Yes, I meant that, I'm not being funny. 
 
 
 We are standing currently at the entrance of this individual's mind. As many of you can already tell, it's a male, well done on you. For those interested, you will see the overall picture from here, he does *not* think about sexual intercourse every seven seconds. He thinks about it every so often. Over to the left, you have Friendship Valley. Why is it a valley? What did I say about questions? Anyways, you can see from here that it has high walls, protected on a constant basis and it is *not* a prison. It's a uptopia for all the thoughts of the mind reserved for his closest friends. 
 
 
 As we continue, directly ahead of us is the main thinking cortex. It's powerful, but it's not clever. Intelligence is relative ma'am, just like your face. Some may think you beautiful, but people are allowed to be *wrong*. You will notice that the storage area is large and has already been divided into several important sections. Notice that *Adventure Time* is becoming a permanent part of this storage and is currently under construction. 
 
 
 Coming up on our left, you will see the Spite and Anger, Fear and Distrust part of the individual's mind. Of course it's large, have you seen what's on the internet? Makes your blood boil. It's storage unit for images and videos is fairly small, but we all make mistakes by focusing on one specific moment, do n't we all? Question? Well, I do n't have an answer. Onto the next portion! 
 
 
 Here we have the creativity filter and thought process creation. It look complex, but if you look at the diagram, then you'll discover it's rather simple. No ma'am, again, no questions. Nor do I have the time or crayons to describe this for you. One of the things that is currently on this individual's mind is writing out stories, specifically on a typewriter. But since he does n't want to appear hipster, he's going for a pretentious gamer look with a mechanical keyboard, colored like a toy. An interesting exhibit indeed. 
 
 
 Oh! And look! You can see the latest thing this individual is working on! It's a short story about describing the inner parts of your mind. Who knows? Maybe he took the prompt a little bit too literally, but I think we can all imagine that it's bound to fail. Next! 
 
 
 The last exhibit. Of course. You'll find that this does n't get too many hits or pictures, mainly because it's the portion of the mind that controls sadness. Oh yes, this part generates so much doubt and depression, that sometimes he thinks about- No, he's not suicidal. That button there? Do n't push it sir, get back into line. Sir?

","As a young woman, she looked very much like Grace Kelly in her pre-princess days, although she had a brittleness in her eyes sometimes that Princess Grace never knew. She was afraid of being alone. 
 
 Her mother had abandoned her and her sister in a train station when she was just six years old. Marianne was eight. `` You wait right here,'' they were told. `` I'll be right back.'' Fortunately, Maggie knew her name and address, and the nice man at the station wired their father. Papa sent money, and they put the girls on the train back to him, unescorted by an adult. They were at the start of a war and at the end of the depression. Time and resources could n't be spared for someone else's children. 
 
 Maggie blamed Papa. Her mother had left him, had n't she? There must be something he did to deserve it! She wanted her mama! He was n't terribly sympathetic to her plight, especially since the other girl was so easygoing and glad to be back where she belonged. Maggie was hurt, angry, and developing a bitterness she'd never overcome. 
 
 Maggie was sharp. She did well in school and loved to read. She could do math that the older kids could n't. She thought maybe she'd teach or be a secretary. Mostly, she wanted to be a mother. She wanted to prove that it could be done so much better than her mother had. 
 
 She married JB when she was 23. He was 28, and a wild thing. He was funny, brilliant, and drank too much. He'd been married twice already and would only be divorced from the second wife for two days when she donned a very stylish dark blue suit and hat to wed him. Oh, he was a challenge. She could handle this big man, though. She did n't care what happened. She was going to do The Right Things. 
 
 What were The Right Things? They were all the things her mother had failed attempting. She would be a faithful wife all her life. She would have two little girls she adored. She would cook and clean and sew Halloween costumes and explain the facts of life, not wait until those poor girls got their periods and were told by a gruff man as an afterthought! She would tolerate JB's drinking. She would be the ideal 60's wife with a big, sparkling smile. She would do everything for everyone in her life by making everything easy for them. She volunteered to be a Brownie leader, she smiled at bridge club, she attended dances at the country club, and she was the asset a businessman's wife was supposed to be. When her husband died in an accident after 25 years, she was stunned, but oddly grateful. She did n't want to keep taking care of him and had thought often of ways to leave, but she would never have done that without her children. Never. 
 
 She helped her youngest daughter raise her own two children after an ugly divorce, and she did it all again. She never took a day off, never rested. She kept house, she cooked, she volunteered and taxied. She did it all again without a single complaint. And without a single emotion. 
 
 Maggie was frozen from the inside. She did what was expected, and she did a better job of it than her mother ever had. She did n't complain because she knew it would n't get her anywhere. She took everything in stride. She took care of everything for everyone, but never showed that she felt fear or pain or affection. She was still that hurt little girl inside. She could n't hug or kiss or cuddle her daughters or grandchildren. There was no point in it, and coddling people only served to make things more difficult when life got hard again, as it always would. 
 
 The night she died, thrashing in agony from heart failure, cancer, and not enough morphine in April of 2013, her daughters promised they would play nicely together even though they were long grown. She had been the perfect mother and grandmother, although she would have scoffed at their hyperbole to hear them say so.

","He had never been lonely, despite always being alone. For most of his life he puttered along, eschewing his peers in favor books and later, the internet. It was simply easier to craft a shell of information and entertainment around himself than it was to suffer the agonies of small talk or the burn of rejection. The intensity of those hurts was so much larger and so much more difficult to manage than the low hum of solitude. 
 
 When he woke up on the day he would come to call Rapture Wednesday, he had n't noticed anything was wrong. Not at first, at least, not until he went outside. 
 
 There were cars sitting in the middle of the street or up on the curb while the traffic lights ticked green-yellow-red in an endless cycle. The engines were running but not one driver's seat was occupied. The seat belts were still buckled across the seats, as if the person sitting there had just *poofed* right out of existence. The shops were empty. At the cafe on the corner, mugs of still-hot coffee sat abandoned with purses and laptop bags at tables. That's when he turned heel and ran home. 
 
 The television was no help. The only programs on were re-runs, regularly scheduled programming. Every news channel he flipped to was silent. The desks where the anchors sat were covered in papers, but no one was behind them. 
 
 Feeling more than a little nauseous, he sat down at his computer and shook the mouse. Everything was as he left it. He began to click around, his dread growing like a heavy stone in his gut. Nothing had been updated, not since 11:59PM Tuesday night. The only emails he had received were obviously automatically distributed spam or advertisements. Reddit was quiet. There were no new tweets, no new YouTube uploads, no news bulletins on CNN, NPR, BBC, or Fox News. There was nothing. It was as if the world screeched to a halt. Everyone had disappeared, but Rapture Wednesday had overlooked him; he was forgotten. 
 
 Figures, he thought. 
 
 He logged onto Facebook, something he had n't done for well over a year. What was the point? His mother, his old physics teacher, and a few random acquaintances were his only'friends', and he had never posted anything himself. Facebook was as quiescent as the rest of the internet. After a moment's hesitation, he typed out a status update: *Where is everyone? What happened? * 
 
 Crickets. 
 
 For the next week, he continued to post. Sometimes he posted on the walls of major companies, like Google or McDonald's, sometimes on his own wall. Nothing changed, no one replied, and his anxiety began to grow. The internet would n't stay on forever. Not if he was the only human left. Infrastructure of any kind required human maintenance, servers included. He was n't approaching Mike Ferris levels of freak-out, but he was getting close. Never before had he wanted to connect with someone so badly. Once the internet went down, the age of connectivity would be over and with it, his best chance of finding out if there was even anyone left to connect with. 
 
 The first Wednesday after The Rapture, he pulled up Facebook once again to write another pointless post. *The barrier of loneliness: The palpable, desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man. Up there, up there in the vastness of space, in the void that is sky, up there is an enemy known as isolation. It sits there in the stars waiting, waiting with the patience of eons, forever waiting... * He sighed and sat back. He removed his glasses and began to polish the lenses with his tee shirt when a sudden sound byte broke the silence. 
 
 He screamed, dropped his glasses, and stood so quickly his swivel chair keeled over with a clatter. It was a notification. He had gotten a notification. Carefully, he groped around for his glasses, shoved them onto his face, and refreshed the page. Someone had replied to his status update. 
 
 *Look at mister edgelord over here, quoting Twilight Zone. * 
 
 Without bothering to right his chair, he leaned in to feverishly type out a reply. A reply to Madeline Albricht of Chicago, IL, whose sarcasm appeared undaunted by the sudden disappearance of nearly all mankind. Madeline Albright, only a stranger and his only hope. 
 
 *You exist!? You did n't poof off with the rest of them? Is there anyone else? * 
 
 Moments after he clicked'post', the screen went black and the lights went out all at once. He screamed again, his hands flying up to grasp the monitor and shake it. It was no use. The power was out, all down the block. He had been disconnected.

13742,"[ WP ] Congress just passed the Prohibition Act of 2016 . Coffee is now a Class 1 illegal drug .
","*The Year: 2116* 
 
 *The Place: Washington, D.C.* 
 
 *News Reporter: * This week marks the 100th anniversary of Congress's historic 2016 Prohibition Act criminalizing crack caffeine, often known to users as `` coffee''. 
 
 Crack caffeine was originally banned because of its contributing role in a variety of social ills, including but not limited to heart disease, type A personalities, overwork, and poor dental health. While crack caffeine is a stimulant, historians have cited its history as an opiate of the masses, making them believe that the oppression of the 9 to 5 workday and the 40 hour workweek was bearable. 
 
 In recent years, however, scientists have begun experimenting with the drug. While these experiments have mainly been limited to non-human subjects, a few prominent companies are poised to start trials administering small drips to humans. It is postulated that crack caffeine's effect on depressed subjects may give it some medicinal merit. 
 
 In this respect, policy seems on pace to outstrip science. Oregon and Washington state, historic crack caffeine hubs, and Washington, D.C., a city where many prominent citizens, including Congresspeople, have been accused of being coffeeheads, are considering legislation to decriminalize crack caffeine. These regions have already instituted policies allowing for medical use of condensed crack caffeine, known to users as `` chocolate''. 
 
 There is no word yet on whether the federal government will continue to enforce crack caffeine prohibitions in states in which it is decriminalized; the federal government is waiting to see if this legislation becomes law.

I screamed, `` Zachariah, where's my fucking candy?'' I found him upstairs, urinating his name onto the floral carpet. `` Zachariah you have consumed twelve hundred micrograms of LSD.''

9926,"[ WP ] A warrior from a planetary culture with literally no concept of surrender or quarter sits detained in a POW camp .
","`` I know he's not from here, but does he have to sit up all night, staring at the Goddamn wall? I know this is a picnic for most of us, but a few these scatterbrains here are just a little on edge as it is.'' 
 
 It was confusion. No one knew what it was, maybe not even the man himself, but each night he would look up at the stars, or even just at a colourless patch of darkness and think and think and think. The wheels would turn inside his head until they lost traction, and every night would end with the bland blue and black canvas, dancing with imagined colours, long after the gears came to a grinding halt. The days were n't so hard. Two Summers had passed already, and everyone knew by then there was n't a soul coming to get them. So in a way we were all like him, though some of us did n't like to see it that way. But shooting hoops out on the dirt, or planting cabbages to pass the time, well it was all the same really. This war ended, we would be the first to go, the burned out scum from a victory pyre or the messy attempts to destroy the evidence as the enemy closed in and thoughts of criminal war courts started to set in. Win or lose, we were stuck on the bottom of the barrel somewhere, it was just a question of how soon you wanted to check out before that time came. 
 
 Sgt. Joseph Miller, that was the first bit of fire and majesty to enter into this camp. He was a legend among the Air Marshals, shot down 13 enemy planes on the attack on Astra Romana, an attack that none of his comrades, God rest their souls, ever made it out of alive, but he sent the Luftwaffe on their way. Took out the refinery too. Yeah, he was the first one. Got out of two POW camps before arriving at this one, and could n't wait to add a third to his list. Why they did n't put a bullet through his head the second they got him from the second attempt had a little to do with notoriety and value, as such, as a prisoner, but had a lot to do with embarrassment over the penetrability of their camps. That's how we saw it anyway. We dug the tunnel, we hid the dirt, got half of us through on the day of and the whole bloody thing collapsed on him. 
 
 There were a few of them to come through like that. It's not hard to remember their names, but it gets harder to remember how soon they come in, one after another. You'd like to think that a lot of time has passed, and that you're deadset against helping them not because you think there's no chance at all, but just because enough time in a place like this does take the fight out of you. A man can only watch so many bullets being shot through the chest of his friends, even through his acquaintances, eventually even through his enemies. There's a set number you can tolerate in a lifetime. No one knows how much that number can climb to, but when you're through, you're through, and there is n't any going back. And yet you'll still see it, the universe has an indifference to it like that, does n't matter how much you can tolerate when there's more coming, but you can choose how much of it you'll participate in. 
 
 There were a few of them like this, but none like Clark Wilson. Officially, he had no rank, and he was iconic alright. You look at his record and it's astonishing the feats he's accomplished, and there was n't a green soldier in here did n't know his name. Yet no rank. Why do you suppose that is? Let me tell you a story. It's a story that I hold personally important as it's one of the few I can verify beyond all the rumors that went floating around getting swollen by feverish nights and boredom, horror, and hearsay. One I was actually there to see. There was this shipment of tires making it's way down the coast of the Mediterranean, out to the old desert fox making his campaign into Benghazi. There was a warehouse in that desert city with several trucks stocked to the brim with our payday, ready to be shipped out that morning. Go in, kill the guards, blow up the trucks, get out. Real simple stuff so long as you knew how to set a bomb off without losing your head in the process. We get to the factory at 20:00 and see the whole thing as this towering mass of flames and ash. No word on a mission abort, no influx of the Kraut scum picking through the rubble and rallying death squads. Just the crackle of fire and the smell of burning rubber on an empty night. Great. Terrific. We were about to abort, give ourselves a pat on the back for a job well done, when we heard this feint sound coming through the roar of the building. Keys on a piano, and you could just barely strain your ears to hear it, Bach's Partita No. 6 in E Minor. Now, this is the time to go. Either it's some onlooker with a death wish singing these notes to the beauty of the night, or someone with a great sense of the bloodshed to come and wanting to savour it preemptively, or who knows what in the fuck because none of this scene makes sense anyway and it's time to get the hell out of there. So we go in. We're looking for the sound of this piano through back alleys that weave along close to the warehouse. There are jeeps piled up on the main road, but no one's inside. People sure got out of them in a hurry by the looks of it, and while I never make a claim to any preternatural insight into the state of the world, you get a sense that they were n't being returned to any time soon. We walk further into the streets, still slinking along the shadows, and another sound comes a little into earshot. Something like a wheezing sound, but it's impossible to describe, almost like it's turned metallic, like your inside of some damp cell with a thousand rats breathing in a single breath and tweeting in between. It's strange. Inside this small room at the top of this apartment building is this thin copper pipe attached to a weight at the bottom that held it upright. There were three kids tied together and bound with the pipe going through each of their throats, one by one, with the sound of their breathing amplified at the top by this cone. They were still alive, even then, when we got there. At the end of the room was a man sitting at the piano and playing. We shot at him, but nothing happened. He just kept playing, did n't phase him. When we could n't kill him and he had no apparent interest in killing us, we asked about the kids, he told me, `` They were n't Americans, and they were going to die anyway. This way they make a good distraction for my team here waiting at the door beside you.'' And he pointed out two men in black completely, ducked down in the darkness. When I asked them why they were `` Going to die anyway'', he looked back down at his keys and said to me, `` Everyone has to.'' 
 
 And now he stares at walls. You are probably wondering about the bullets bit, or why he has no title and still we do n't lodge a bullet in the back of his head that might sit. Two answers that are n't probably going to sit too well. The first is, they say anyway, he came from the sky. No one knows a day before this where he came from, but the story is he floated down here one day, been fighting ever since. And thankfully on our side of the fence. Top brass does n't give a shit who they keep on payroll, so long as they do n't have to pay them or give them credit for the crimes against humanity they commit. Must be for him that we're something more like livestock, I do n't know, but he plays nice with us, and we have a war to win. No one is going to bargain for this one, either, the whole world wants him, but no one wants to say they bailed him out. 
 
 I looked at him one night, I never wanted to think of a person like this again, reminded me too much of the people I work for, and the soft underbelly I'm rotting here to protect. But I opened my eyes to look at him one night to find that the sparkle was pointing right back at me. `` You want to know why I'm here, is that it?'' A soft voice called out in the darkness. `` Do n't flatter yourself.'' And I closed my eyes, but I could n't get the thought out of my head, `` Why do n't you leave? Does n't seem like bullets add much in the way as deterrents.'' I waited, but I could n't tell if he was even thinking about it anymore, he just kept staring at me, without blinking, and smiling blindly into the darkness, `` I will, I'll leave. I thought there was some value to gaining knowledge and insight, or that the Germans had given up in some way.'' he was twirling his fingers together, getting visibly more anxious with his shoulders screwing up as he talked, `` I did n't know you could n't hurt each other because you all experience it, this is what I've figured out here. Since I know that, I have to get ready to leave. Leave everything.''

15009,"[ WP ] A young girl dies and finds out that she is next in line to take the role of Grim Reaper
","`` Why me?'' she asks, voice worried. Not anger, not indignation, just concern and curiosity. Only a child could muster up those emotions at a time like this. After being told they were to be consigned to harvesting souls for at least another eighty years. I was ninety now, ten when I died. Perhaps the pattern continued. 
 
 And what was I supposed to tell her? I had a million theories, musings used to pass the dull boring years. 
 
 You, because, despite whatever your parents told you, life is n't fair, and the powers that be choose their servants at random? 
 
 You, because the gods want to start the Reapers young, and milk them for every second they're worth? 
 
 You, because they think a cute little girl, a pretty young lady, or a kindly old woman would ease the suffering of the dying? 
 
 You, because sometimes children get a second lease of life, even if it is n't the one they expected or deserved? 
 
 You, because random chance found you dying just as the last Reaper was to be relieved of their duty? 
 
 No, I told her none of this. I did what my predecessor had, all three of us just links in a neverending cycle. I wiped the tears from her cheeks, placed the robe firmly around her shoulders, kissed her forehead gently, and went off to receive the fate I had doled out so often before.

 Fourteen years have now passed. I can ’ t believe it has been fourteen years, that ’ s crazy! Anyway tonight I ’ m going out with friends. There is this new bar called Feugo ’ s that has opened up and now that I can legally dink I thought I might try it! Like I said last time, this has been a long time coming! I might even try it with Ariana tonight. Jack is coming to, he said that we could `` wingman'' each other, he has some proper sick ideas for drinking games before hand to. Going to be one hell of a wild night! I would write for longer but got to get ready for tonight man! Am I looking forward this! Peace Out x

 So I just found this old diary of mine. Ten years since my last post, you can tell to as there ain ’ t much left of it! Just read through the last post left in the thing and it is not pretty! Although to be fair I do still rember that night and it was indeed wild, I did get with Ariana in the end! 
 
 
 So what has changed in ten years? Well certainly not the infant mortality rate, which is the same and has been for 24 years now! I know, not funny. Seriously not much has changed, well nothing to big anyway. I guess the university thing is big. The only surviving school or university in the whole world is Oxford now. No new people for uni for six years, so tehy they where all just haemorrhaging money. I mean that is pretty big! Oh actually there is one thing, there is a twenty year old called Alison Brandi and she has just signed a contract worth almost 1 billion dollars over ten years. She works in the adult industry and obviously they are craving for the youngsters. I know sex sells but 1 Billion is absolutely bonkers, it is the premium you pay for the youngest person on earth. Still, it is quite the investment. 
 
 
 It is quite odd actually I am only 24 and yet I ’ m seen as old. Jack reckons we are going to be screwed by the time we grow we old. Who is going to pay our pension, who is going to care for us? I told him he was exaggerating they ’ ll develop a proper test tube baby soon, he does n't agree. One minute he is having a laugh and the next he gets all serious! I mean I love the man but he can be a bit of a downer sometimes he is not as bad as the rest of them though. Everyone always seems so bleak! They are always moaning about everything, they all walk round expressionless! At least the government know what they are doing, investing in the future; they are talking about selling off some services to set up funding for research into why the infertility thing happened. It will help us get to the bottom of the problem and solve it. Anyway I better be off man, see you soon. Peace Out.

 I dug this out thinking I could read about Jack but it hasn ’ t helped. As I write this, I write with a heavy heart and lump in my throat. Today Jack officially passed on. I don ’ t know what to do with myself. I ’ ve been trying to keep myself occupied but I just can ’ t do it. Even something simple like the news won ’ t help. It is just all stories about the collapse in Sierra Leone. I forget momentarily but then it all comes flooding back. The pictures of the government don ’ t help either. I ’ m just heartbroken. He was my best friend and now there is nothing, he just doesn ’ t exist! How can a man go from being there to just not? I can ’ t take it. 
 
 It is the governments fault. They are running out of money because there are less workers to earn them money and more pensioners to pay. They sold pretty much everything, including the health service. The owners are just trying to make as much money as they can now, when you couple that with the fact that the population is constantly decreasing, it means that the human body has now become a finite and valuable resource. In fact it has now become a commodity. Jack was blood type AB which was already rare he needed a transfusion because his kidney was n't working, something like that, but by now it has become far too expensive. Only the rich can afford it and the poor take the brunt. This country is going to the dogs. The world is going to the dogs. 
 
 
 Even last week Sierra Leone officially ceased to exist as a country. The men and women who farm there have relied on their children and young men for generations but obviously that has become a problem. No one could do the work efficiently meaning families could n't feed which made an already low life expectancy almost non-existent. Everything is just starting to tip. I had n't really thought about how bad it was, I just kept living like most do. Jacks death has opened my eyes though. Now that his constant pessimism is gone I realise that he was right all along.

 It is almost done now. The government has fallen completely; they've sold everything, what is left to do? They still exist but they do nothing, nothing. Men in suits control everything, the government could n't afford to pay me or give me a pension whereas the fat cat business man could. Naturally I flew to the fat cat. It is so hard to get job though, the fall of most of Europe, Asia and Africa has resulted in mass immigration. Those people are willing to work for next to nothing so we have to as well if we want a job and I need one. There is almost nothing left. The government has no power; the people are under the control of business. Nothing can be done. I ’ m starting to think that maybe I should have listened more to Jack all those years ago, we could have got out early. Each year the retirement age is pushed further and further back and each year I regret what will come with the next.

 I am now 56 years of age. I have out lived most everyone and thing I have ever known. I don ’ t know who will read this. Maybe evolution will create a new breed of sentient beings but more likely not. This journal will become like my life, pointless and aimless. Nothing happens anymore. All structures have collapsed, not a single large business or government remain anywhere in the world. There is simply nothingness. I ’ m sitting on a boat sailing across the pacific while writing this. I just needed to get out of England, out of Europe and ideally I just want out. I ’ m hoping the boat will crash and we will drown. I have no skills anymore, no one does. The youngest man on this planet is 52, within a few years even they will become incapable then soon after they will die. I am by no means old but I feel as though I have had enough. I gave the last of the caps I owned to a sailor about to head off and here I am. He is sitting in his cabin and I ’ m out here on the deck. I ’ ve tried three times already to just be done with it and jump but every time I do, I can ’ t. 
 
 
 These last few years have pushed me over the edge, derelict streets and buildings everywhere. Rarely a person in sight, only few remained and soon it would be none. The entire population would be gone, a world savaged by violence, greed and destruction. These streets where excessive and big because of mans greed, they were busy and lively because of mans greed and now they lie barren because of mans greed. I am and have been used to loneliness for a while now but not emptiness, emptiness is different. I don ’ t know if it was God who took away the children or if it was science. There is one thing I am sure of though, we brought this upon ourselves. Our people fought each other for scraps, they fought each other for entitlement and greed and in the end they fought each other because they knew nothing else. Greed was what made man great and greed is what made man fall.

2175,"[ WP ] As a child , you were kidnapped by a roving gang of marauders . A year later , you were saved by a dragon , who now seeks to raise you as her own .
","“ Raising a human is going to be more difficult than I thought. ” 
 
 Mother ’ s voice was as deep as the mountain lakes. It must have been a tough admission for her, a thousand years old and wiser than any living thing. Her eyes burned with an intense fire as she stared down at me, small and pink and so un-dragon-like. 
 
 The pain of the weeping burns along my right arm and thigh slowly faded as her hypnotic gaze worked its magic. 
 
 She turned to my brother, Essk, beside me. 
 
 “ He needs a human healer. Take some gold and take him to the outskirts of the village. Do not let yourself be seen. ” 
 
 With two great talons, she delicately picked a shed dragon-scale from the floor and placed it in my hand. “ When you enter the village, find the old man, Neeko. Give him the scale. He will take you in. Trust no one else in the village. ” 
 
 
 Essk and I walked through the passage towards the horde to get a few gold pieces. My shirt was only half on because the cloth against the burn was excruciating. I still wore my pants despite the burn on my thigh- because of my pride- and walked with a flinching limp. 
 
 “ This was no accident, ” he said to me. “ Ortch meant to hurt you. ” 
 
 “ I thought he was my brother. ” I wanted to wallow in denial, but I was growing afraid. 
 
 “ He is jealous. You are not like us. He fears that mother favors you and he wants to point up your vulnerability. ” 
 
 “ What am I going to do? I AM vulnerable. I have no scales, no fire, I can not fly. ” 
 
 We walked for a moment in silence. We had all been playing, the brood of us. My brothers Essk and Ortch, and our sisters Flessa and Cirra. I had been riding on the back of the sunset-hued Flessa. Ortch was “ it ” and banked in towards Flessa, trailing flame. Her wing dipped and the fire swept across my right side. I remember Ortch had laughed as he twisted away. 
 
 I begged Flessa to land and she seemed to not sense my distress until Essk and Cirra flanked her and nearly forced her to ground. Ortch approached at one point and the sky-blue Cirra put teeth marks on his wing. 
 
 Essk spoke again, shaking me from my recollection. 
 
 “ This is a difficult problem, ” he said, echoing mother. “ I will think on it. ” 
 
 No idle offer from him. Though we were both just 13, he seemed to have been born with a hundred years of wisdom. 
 
 “ …my brother, ” he added. 
 
 
 At the aerie ledge, high on the mountain, I carefully shrugged on my tunic, three gold coins in the pocket. I hoped the cold wind of the flight would be soothing, but it was predawn in the mountains and more than just cool. I struggled onto Essk ’ s shoulders. 
 
 I presumed the rest of the brood was asleep still, which was fine with me. I wanted no trouble on this flight. I was nervous anyway about being among humans again. But after Essk launched from the ledge and began a gentle glide down the valley, I spotted Cirra circling in the high clouds, keeping watch. 
 
 
 Essk dropped me off just before the sun rose. He paused before taking flight again. 
 
 “ There is a thing that you can do that we can not. ” 
 
 He had a sly half-grin in response to my puzzled look. After letting me wonder for a moment, he finished: “ You can whistle! ” 
 
 He grinned wide, scaly lips showing dagger-like teeth, and he was right. I could put two fingers to my lips a blow a piercing note that would scatter the sheep on the hillside. 
 
 “ If you run into any trouble in the village, blow. Cirra and I will be listening not far away. ” 
 
 And then he was gone. 
 
 
 In the village, I stopped at the well in the square and waited. Not long, and an old woman came for water. In truth, she wore the haggard look of a difficult life, masquerading as years. Over that lay suspicion. 
 
 “ Can you tell me where Neeko lives? ” 
 
 By the way her face twisted, the name confirmed her worst thoughts. Nevertheless, she replied, pointing a finger across the small square. 
 
 “ Go down that street. Go until the cobbles end and the road is dirt. Count three alleys on your heart-side. That old sorcerer lives in the third alley. ” 
 
 Her bucket full, she sloshed away. She looked back several times with that twisted face as if memorizing details to recount to others. It gave me a bad feeling. 
 
 I found alley, as the village was slowly awakening to greet the day. There were many deepset, ramshackle doorways and no way to know which was Neeko ’ s. But one of them opened as I passed and a small wrinkled man inside appeared, a thin cloud of white hair about his pate. He smiled a snaggle-toothed grin and beckoned with a single word. 
 
 “ Changeling! ” 
 
 I entered his domicile and he leaned out and glanced furtively up and down the street, then shut the door tight. My eyes adjusted to the dark room, lit only by the embers in the hearth. 
 
 “ Why are you here, dragon-boy? ” 
 
 I slipped the scale from my tunic and handed it to him. His eyes grew large. After turning it in his hands a couple times, he looked back at me questioningly. He knew that something was expected in return. In response, I peeled away my shirt. 
 
 Again his eyes grew large. 
 
 “ I see, adopt of dragons is not the wonder I might have thought! ” 
 
 He rummaged among the busy shelves and finally pulled down a small crock labelled ‘ dragon scales ’ and dropped his payment inside. By the sound, it was the only one. Replacing that crock, he rummaged again, coming forth with a somewhat larger stained and greasy crock. 
 
 With three fingers, he scooped out an ointment and began to gently rub it into my raw skin. I flinched as it stung at first, but then began to sooth. 
 
 “ I can not imagine wonders you have seen, among the dragons, ” he spoke with a whispery voice, like the rustling of leaves, as he administered his care. “ But it seems some danger you are in. Scales you need more than I, but not one… your whole body! ” 
 
 He smiled ruefully, then seemed to lose himself in thought. The analgesia of the salve made me sleepy. He may have continued speaking, but I was drifting away. 
 
 
 At some point, I opened my eyes to see him kneeling before the fire. He held tongs in one hand, which in turn held the scale of the dragon over the coals. A gold piece lay in the concavity of the scale and glowed bright yellow. His other hand worked a bellows. I felt the warmth on my face with each gust of air, but my body was relaxed and painless seemingly far off. I had no idea how much time had passed. 
 
 
 My next awakening was not so peaceful. There was pounding on the door, and angry shouting outside. Neeko was dodging about his small room, hiding things, or looking for something. I sat up and a sharp pain shot up my side. The door burst open and rough hands dragged me from the bed. 
 
 “ There he is! ” 
 
 “ The dragon-boy! ” 
 
 “ Let ’ s see if he will burn! ” 
 
 “ Ransom him for dragon gold! ” 
 
 The rough handling was tearing at my burns. I was pulled into the street, eyes squeezed shut trying not to yell out from the pain. We were headed back to the square. I wrenched free with a great searing flash of pain and raised my fingers to my lips. The piercing note quieted the mob for just an instant. A distant part of my mind noticed a gold ring was on my finger. They quickly seized me again and momentum carried us onward to the square. 
 
 A great post had been set into the ground, with brush and kindling piled around it. I scanned the sky desperately as the tone of the crowd began to take on a malicious excitement. 
 
 It was difficult to concentrate through the pain of my burns, and it was all a mish-mash of impressions. Unwashed bodies hemming me in, pushing me onward. Neeko being brutally pushed along behind us. A grasping hand tugging at my finger trying to remove the gold ring. 
 
 And suddenly a shadow swept over the crowd. The excitement turned to a dread urgency. Ropes suddenly appeared and were being wrapped around me. Those with torches crowded close. 
 
 I was looking up as the shadow flew past again. My thudding heart dropped as if into a pit. It was the black scales of Ortch.

","Callouses are only formed on the bodies most equipped to deal with them, my father always said. He'd come home, silt stuck in his brow, heaving from the heavy blows of another forest fire. That's all we ever worried about now, especially after our longer than average drought season. It's been years since I've seen him, but that heroic image burned forever in my head, like flames on a hardwood floor. Training started three weeks ago, and already I could feel the callouses begin to form on my once soft hands. 
 This is n't a profession for women they said, but I insisted. That's one of our lessons, persistence. If you do n't have it, the fire will win. You must always persist through the flames, until you've found the source. That was the easy lesson, now came the hard part, hand to hand combat. 
 It's been decades since water stopped working on flames, it's more of a running joke now. The course only has three more weeks before our final fight, after that we will be sent out like cattle to slaughter, with nothing but well wishes and hope for the best.

I get the first to be the first to reestablish contact. Here of all places almost exactly in the middle of the 2 planets. As if we were called together at the same time. 
 
 Swoosh. The door slides open revealing a small grey room with a metallic grey table with matching chairs on either side. Across the room another door is opening in sync with my own. 
 
 Average. Completely normal. The man on the other side of the door looks just like any other person. A little tense looking but completely normal. I feel a sigh of relief escape my mouth. I seem to notice a small change in his demeanor as well. He appears to be more relaxed. 
 
 I begin to step forward to meet with him. He follows suit and we meet in the middle of the room to the right of the table. I reach out my hand to offer a handshake. His hand raises as well but his hand is in a fist. Almost as if he is going for a fist bump. I close my hand to accommodate. But he seems to open up his hand. Oh god this is awkward. Our hands finally meet his whole hand wrapping around my fist with a shaking motion. We both smile as if we both acknowledge the stupidity that had just unfolded before us. 
 
 I hesitantly say “ Hello! I am Sam Burwell. ” 
 
 “ Hi! Bill Mixon. ” He replies. 
 
 “ Shall we start. ” 
 
 “ Sure.'' 
 
 Stepping back we took our seats, still facing each other. I chuckle under my breadth and swear he does the same. 
 
 So many questions. I ’ m sure he has so many too. I begin, “ I ’ m sorry we haven ’ t come sooner. To be honest we all thought you were dead. ” 
 
 “ Our founders fought through some tuff times, but somehow they made it and established a great society here. Why would you think we were dead? ” he ended puzzled. 
 
 “ Well, around the time your ‘ founders ’ left. A great plague hit the Earth. It seemed to be everywhere all at once and spreading fast. We couldn ’ t be sure that the members of the crew weren ’ t infected. ” I explained. 
 
 “ Oh Gihal, I ’ m sorry! How bad was it? ” 
 
 “ We lost 95 percent of the Earth ’ s population. The sickness seemed to target the best and brightest of us. Which is another reason we thought your ‘ founders ’ may have it... It took us a long time to rediscover all the technology we lost. ” I replied sadly. 
 
 “ Our Founders tell us that they lost communication with the home planet... ‘ eeearth ’ I think you said. Perhaps this plague is why? … Wow! Amazing! That is why you haven ’ t come earlier. ” He exclaimed with the excitement of the new discovery. 
 
 He continued “ When the Founders lost communication they pushed on with the mission. Establish a new home grow and multiply. But they crashed upon landing on lost half the crew and most of the supplies. ” 
 
 “ But here you are. So they must have done something right. ” 
 
 “ Yes… Yes they did. ” 
 
 “ So… why seek out Earth now? ” I asked. 
 
 “ When we decided to explore deeper space. Our first choice was always to seek out the home planet. And you, why seek us out now? ” 
 
 “ We wanted to colonize again and your planet was still the first and best choice. Plus the benefit of a slim chance that you survived. ” 
 
 “ Well, this is all a very formal discussion. Would you like to see my ship? ” He asked. 
 
 Shocked, I looked at him. He seemed genuine in his excitement and sincere in his hospitality. Leaning my head to my right, “ Commander... permission to bored the colonists' ship? ” 
 
 “ Permission granted. ” 
 
 “ Great its settled. Follow me. ” Bill said as he stood and turned.

I know i didn ’ t see it when he walked in, but how could I it was behind him. He had a tail that that seemed as tall as long as him. It reminded me of the monkeys I ’ d seen in history books. 
 
 He turned and looked back, “ OH! This. Sorry. Ya it is kind of long. But the ladies don ’ t complain… eehhh. ” He exclaimed with a smile on his face. `` How long is your ’ s?''

5300,"Meet and Greet/Question of the Week # 2 : When did you discover that you enjoyed writing , and why do you do it ?
","Hey everyone! I missed last week's introduction so I'll do that really quickly before I get into this week's question. 
 
 I a male who lives in New Jersey of the USA. I'm 20 years old and currently a full-time student. You can call me Sniper or Snipes to make it easier if you ever respond to my comments or anything. 
 
 Anyway, back to the question. 
 
 I think I always had a passion for writing, even at a young age, my parents told me that I used to write all the time. But I think I only really got into it about three years ago and have tried to keep writing every chance I could get. At first it started out as a way for me to just get what I wanted to say down on paper, and I kept a journal for a while, but it eventually evolved into this chance to create something entirely new. 
 
 And I loved that. The ability to take something from your own imagination ( or from a simple idea ) and put it on paper to create this world where you can get wrapped up into. When I started writing ( for real ) three years ago I had an idea for a novel I wanted to write. That idea has now changed and evolved into something even better in my opinion and I continue to work on it now and then. 
 
 Writing, for me, started as something to do for myself and myself only. I rarely shared my writing. I felt it was n't good enough, that it was only for me, and I think that's where a lot of people stop. I did n't view myself as a writer until this year, after I took a course in creative writing and when I started submitting to writing prompts. The community here has helped me actively work on my writing and it has helped me improve all the same. I thank you all for that because now I have never been more confident in my writing and I am proud of that. 
 
 Writing to me is a chance to create, and I think that's amazing.

","`` $ 4.79,'' the gas station cashier announced right before smacking the gum she was chewing loudly. She looked to be about 19, clearly not mainstream type, with her spiked short hair and nose ring betraying her disdain for the world around her. 
 
 `` Could you also put twenty on number two?'' I had come in to pay for gas, but my obsession with **I Love NY** paraphernalia had gotten the better of me when I caught a glimpse of what was sure to be my new Friday keychain. My thoughtlessness was not lost on `` Sativa'' as she gave an audibly exaggerated sigh, and added the new line item. 
 
 *Right. What was I thinking? How dare I ruin your nearly perfect day of 3 customers per shift, none of which required you to move more than twelve inches to push a button, announce a total, and rip off a receipt? * 
 
 I reached into my wallet and pulled out a crisp new fifty, fresh from the bank yesterday, and handed it to her. Another disapproving look, but this time, she would not acquiesce. 
 
 `` I'm not taking that. It's after ten o' clock.'' 
 
 Of course. Why in the world would a store take cash from a customer? I silently scowled as I put the bill back and pulled out my credit card. At least I'd get the rewards from it. Last month, I got a $ 25 gift card in the mail. I used it for porn. 
 
 As I presented my card, she reached across the table, stopping just inches away, and gesturing for me to place it in her outstretched palm. I did so with more force than I intended, and inadvertently intertwined a finger with hers. 
 
 **BOOM! ** 
 
 
 Time stopped, the universe slowed down around us. It seemed as if we were caught in a swirling eddy of raw energy. In an instant, a lifetime of memories flashed before me. 
 
 A little girl crying in the driveway as a bright yellow corvette drives away. 
 
 `` Daddy!!'' 
 
 
 Flash forward. A boy. Eddie. He said he was her friend, but he's hurting her and she's not strong enough to get away. 
 
 `` Please, Eddie. It hurts.'' 
 
 
 Flash forward. Mom. She's usually awake by now. Something's wrong, she feels cold. There's an empty plastic bag next to a spoon, a lighter, and two needles. 
 
 `` 911? I think my mom just oh-deed on heroin.'' 
 
 
 And just like that, it was over. I stared at her. She stared right back, the cynicism gone from her eyes. Those innocent eyes that witnessed such things. 
 
 I broke the stare first, collecting my keychain and wallet from the counter. Silently, she handed me my receipt. I took it, and smiled with a new understanding of this young girl.

221,"[ WP ] A fairy tells it 's children a human tale before bed
","They began the chant of night that would coax the stars into shining and make the sprites cry out the dew in rapture, but before the first verse had ended, the fairy child was bored. 
 
 `` Instead of the songs,'' whispered Piliffa, `` will you get out a Book?'' 
 
 `` Our somber little Pilly!'' 
 
 Piliffa pouted. `` I'll put my head in the clouds for you tomorrow, if only you'll read to me.'' 
 
 `` A sensible story for you, dear heart, of course, of course,'' they hummed, as the volume tumbled into their arms and opened to the one they liked the best. 
 
 `` Once upon a time, there lived a dog in a cage. Like some of the other dogs, it had been there so long it did n't remember where it came from. The dog was afraid of the long-legged smelly furless ones who always walked past and looked at it. Those were called humans, and they did n't have wings, but sometimes they fed the dog and opened the cage to touch it, so that it became less and less afraid. 
 
 `` One day a small human was very glad to see the dog. The others made small worried eyes at the child and talked while the child sobbed and raged. But they talked until the noises changed to laughter. The cage opened. They took it out of the big boxy building full of doors and the dog saw the sun and leapt in the fragrant grass with joy. 
 
 `` But the leash hurt the dog's neck when it tried to run and play. And long before it was done relishing the beauty of the new air, the humans got out an even smaller cage and led the dog toward it. Fear flashed in the dog. It bit and clawed and desperately howled! The small one was in the way of its escape and its familiar cries joined the howling and raving as blood flew from veins to earth. 
 
 `` The screaming humans dragged the dog away from the silent child and back to the building. One of the others took it to a new room with no dogs and no locks. This human used to pet the dog gently and speak to it so softly. But now it was making a new kind of face with wide eyes and pressed lips and the dew came dripping while it strapped the dog down to the table. The dog yelped when the human stabbed its leg with a flask full of sleep, and that was the last sound it ever gave to the world.'' 
 
 `` Do n't forget the last part,'' yawned Piliffa, now buried under the gossamer. 
 
 Grinning, they sang, `` And the moral of the story is!'' and they chanted it til the dawn.

8877,"[ WP ] A man is holding up a bank , but in the midst of doing so , sees his wife and kid ( s ) are in the bank too .
","I allowed the current of people around me to carry me to the target the brick-faced bank occupying the corner of this street. In my head, I chanted a mantra, `` No need to be nervous, it's a routine job.'' But the words carried no weight. Coincidentally, the pistol tucked into my jeans seemed extra heavy today. I could n't figure out why I was so nervous- it *was* just a routine job... Maybe I was forgetting something? Only time could tell. 
 
 I stepped into the bank, allowing the honking and chatter of the outside world to instantly be silenced, replaced with a too-complete quiet. The alcove behind the door hid me just enough to slid on my mask without being seen. The mask did block some of my peripheral vision, but it blocked more of my face, so it was a trade-off. 
 
 I stepped into the center of the lobby, and just as a few eyes were drawn to me, I swiftly drew the gun from my pants. Or I tried. What really happened was that the sight caught on the lip of my jeans, and I spun around on the spot trying to draw it from my pants. 
 
 Now, with every eye in the room on me, I triumphantly swung the gun up, jabbing it into the face of a few people around me, eliciting a satisfying whimper from each. 
 
 `` If you cooperate, this'll go down easy, I swear.'' The only response was a few tiny sobs. They quivered in their spots, but none dared move from where they stood. 
 
 Shoving my way through the crowd, I started, `` Let's make this eas-SHIT!'' The whole room jumped as a stray shoelace sent me toppling to the ground. My gun tumbled away with a loud clacking, but the surprise kept my victims too dumbstruck to move, so I swept it up, and popped back to my intimidating form. After a cough, I repeated, `` Let's make this easy!'' 
 
 At the desk, I rested my pistol pointing at the clerk, then had a realization. 
 
 `` You do n't happen to have, like, a baggie? For the money?'' I whispered, after casting a glance over my shoulder. 
 
 The tiny man shook his head furiously, pulling a curse from me. 
 
 `` Actually,'' came a woman's voice from behind me, a bit too chipper, `` Y'know I think I might have one in my purse.'' 
 
 I spun around to be met by the part of her hair, given that she was looking down to root around in her purse. A sense of foreboding struck as I realized that this was a cranium I had smooched many times before. 
 
 My wife, Marsha, snapped into a tense position, pulling from her purse a revolver. `` Harold, you are *such* a fuckass.'' Her cute, curvy face held a wickedly thin smile. 
 
 Confused murmurs swept through the room, a few of which were attributed to me. 
 
 Rolling her eyes at the noise, Marsha tilted her gun hand to the side, and peered down at her watch, while the other hand pinned her purse to the opposite shoulder. She said, `` Max has soccer practice in an hour, and you *agreed* to take him!'' Beside her, our eight-year-old son glared through furrowed eyes above crossed arms. 
 
 `` Fuckass,'' he agreed. 
 
 `` Wha-'' 
 
 `` Listen, baby, I'm not mad... Let's- let's just finish this and go home, okay? Maybe we can get ice cream on the way?'' she finished, emphatically, to which Max cheered. 
 
 As she stole my spot at the counter, I finally managed to reign in my confusion. I interrupted her threatening the clerk with, `` What the *hell* is going on?'' and whisked my mask off. 
 
 `` Do *not* take that tone with me,'' Marsha returned, holding her purse open on the counter, her fiery gaze held to mine. The man behind the counter began to shovel bills into her bag. 
 
 `` Sorry, honey,'' I stammered. 
 
 `` Well,'' she huffed, pulling the bulging purse back to her shoulder, `` I had the same idea as you, only I was n't going to make such a scene. Quick and quiet. Which is really odd, because if either of us was going to be doing something quickly and quietly,'' she smirked, `` I would've thought it'd be you.'' A few of the hostages actually chuckled. 
 
 My cheeks burning red, I shouted at the clerk, `` Bring more. I'll carry it out in my goddamn pockets.'' 
 
 `` No,'' the man now carried Marsha's smirk, `` I do n't think I will.'' 
 
 `` I swear to fucking God, I'll pull this trigger!'' I warned. 
 
 `` Would n't matter!'' Marsha cut in with a singsong voice, chewing absentmindedly on one of her nails, `` The safety's on. Can we wrap this up?'' 
 
 I took half a minute to deactivate the safety, the shoved the gun back at the man. `` Money. Now.'' 
 
 The man just rolled his eyes and gestured for the next in line to come to the counter. The young lady behind me actually stepped up. 
 
 `` I'm gon na shoot you in the fucking *face* if you do n't bring me what I want!'' I screamed, to which the clerk guffawed. 
 
 I pulled the trigger, and the hammer clicked, but nothing further happened. The man did n't even flinch. He had already taken the woman's form and was preoccupied. 
 
 `` Oh, Harold,'' Marsha crooned, grabbing my arm, `` It happens to a lot of men, it's nothing to be ashamed of! Let's go.'' The bank erupted in cacophonous laughter. 
 
 `` Marsha-'' but she was already leading me outside. Halfway there, she confiscated my gun and put them both in her purse. 
 
 I held the door for her and Max, letting it slam closed, but I could still hear the laughter.

 He said this before looking around, before taking in his surroundings, before any of the men and women present there had the chance to say anything. 
 
 Finally, one of them found their voice. 
 
 `` You know why are you here?'' 
 
 The room looked like any operating theater, but that was n't what the question was about. 
 
 `` Of course I know. Do you know what you just did is punishable with death?'' 
 
 The religious groups really did a number on this issue. 
 
 Ignoring his question the same man that talked earlier repeated his question: 
 
 `` Do you know why you are here?'' 
 
 `` I killed myself. I wanted to be dead. I'm not. That stupid bitch must have payed for my resurrection. Jesus Christ, how stupid can someone be? I offed myself to get rid of her and that little bastard, and she wo n't let me even have that.'' 
 
 Somewhere nearby a woman started crying. 
 
 He tried getting up, but he fell as soon as his feet touched the floor. 
 
 A young nurse moved to help him but he rejected her outstretched arm with a frown. 
 
 `` When can I go?'' 
 
 `` And kill yourself again? You will leave the premises of this institution after you will be deemed psychologically fit by our psychiatrists. Until then, you will undergo therapy, mental and physical.'' That was a woman talking. She seemed to be a doctor and kept herself in shadows until she spoke. He did n't noticed her at the beginning. 
 
 `` You resurrection cost a lot of money and resources. It would be a waste to let you go and do it again,'' The man from before spoke again. `` You are not legally dead. Once released you will be able to claim your old life back.'' 
 
 `` But that's what I did n't want! You fucking assholes. What happened to the Hippocratic Oath, huh?'' 
 
 He should've made sure his body wo n't be found until it was too late for resurrection, but he never thought there was someone that wanted him alive. He closed his eyes, the sedatives kicking in, and fell asleep dreaming of things his waking mind had no hope of understanding.

12583,"[ WP ] Harry Potter is actually sorted into Slytherin on his first day at Hogwarts . Write the ending of the series .
","Harry stood, covered in the rubble from his final fight with the dark lord. Images flashed before his mind, the Longbottom boy decapitating the snake with the sword, watching Blaise duel with two death eaters at once, his final desperate expelliarmus that had won the day. He turned the elder wand once over in his hand, feeling a slight, magical hum from the instrument of power. The resurrection stone sat heavy in his pocket, the cloak hung loosely at his side. Master of death, he thought to himself, and laughed aloud, startling the slumbering paintings of the headmasters. A true master of death would have been able to save his friends. 
 
 “ Are you quite all right, Harry? ” The suddenness of the question, rather than it ’ s force, nearly caused Harry to jump out of his skin. He whirled around to find himself face-to-face with the portrait of Dumbledore. Instantly, Harry returned to those long, hellish nights spent poring over the pensieve. Harry had never taken quite as quickly to these lessons as he had to occlumency. 
 
 “ I ’ m fine, thanks, ” Harry replied, fixing his glasses which had been knocked to one side when he jumped, “ Sir, ” he added hastily, not knowing if the painting still wanted to be referred to as such. 
 
 “ You seem troubled, ” Dumbledore remarked, his long fingers touched together, peering at Harry over top of his glasses. 
 
 “ It ’ s just that I gathered all the Hallows, sir. I should have been master of death, instead, I still feel lost. I guess I don ’ t understand, sir. I don ’ t know if Voldemort and I were ever all that different. ” 
 
 “ If you will do me one last kindness, Harry, would you look into the Pensieve? I have one thing I have not yet shown you. ” Harry approached the Pensieve with apprehension. There was one memory that clearly was for him, in a small, tube with a golden stopper. Gold for Griffindor. Harry thought back to a choice he had made seven years ago, and wondered how things might have been different. He took a deep breath, and made the last plunge. 
 
 Harry found himself in Dumbledore ’ s office, watching Dumbledore and Tom Riddle, in prefect uniform, having one of their discussions. 
 
 “ But sir! ” exclaimed Riddle, “ Isn ’ t it true that Hufflepuff must lose, as they take what ’ s left! They don ’ t value intelligence, or bravery, or cleverness at all! ” 
 
 “ Tom, if you still believe that, I fear we have taught you nothing in your years here. As it is, I ’ m afraid the decision stands. Hufflepuff wins the House Cup. ” 
 
 “ Sir, please reconsider. I don ’ t understand what merits the house can have. ” Riddle looked flustered, a look Harry had seen on his face today, when he saw the arc of red light fly from Harry ’ s wand. 
 
 “ Tom, I ’ m afraid I don ’ t have a direct hand in the winner. I ’ m sorry, but that ’ s all I can do for you today. ” Riddle turned and began to walk out of the room. “ Tom? ” Dumbledore called after him. Riddle turned his face, his body still towards the exit, “ You would do well to remember that it ’ s not house, strength, or even blood that determines greatness. It is the choices that a wizard makes that determines how he will be remembered. ” Riddle turned on his heel without a word, and descended the staircase. 
 
 The memory over, Harry shook himself off. He sat for a long time in Dumbledore ’ s office, thinking to himself. Then, as though he had been planning this moment his whole life, he pulled the green and silver tie from his pocket and unwrapped the Resurrection Stone. Pointing the Elder Wand directly at it, he muttered “ Reducto, ” and watched as it crumbled apart into nothing. He looked again at the elder wand, giving it one last, look of longing, and then strode over to the sorting hat. 
 
 “ Oy, who ’ s there?'' 
 
 “ It ’ s Harry Potter. You might remember me from seven years—, ” 
 
 “ Ah yes, I remember you Potter. Here to get sorted again? You could have done great things in Griffindor. ” 
 
 “ No, thanks. I was actually hoping you might store something for me. ” 
 
 “ I ’ ve only done that for a few wizards and witches, Potter. What is this item? ” without saying anything, Harry slipped the Elder Wand from his pocket into the base of the hat. There was silence for a few moments, and then the hat spoke. “ I trust you understand what you ’ re doing? ” 
 
 “ Yes, I do. Perhaps its power can die with me. ” 
 
 “ All right then. Have a good day Mister Potter. ” Harry turned one last time to look at the office of the man he hadn ’ t known was his friend, and then walked down the stairs to the world that lay below.

He knew he had to be careful and discrete but, after all, there was a reason he was the one chosen to do it. 
 
 The silhouetted figure approached, and loomed over him. 6'5''. Black. Holy shit, this guy was intimidating. `` You got it?'' Carson queried casually. `` All here. All ready.'' Smiled the newcomer, showing teeth that could crush his forearm with one bite. `` Then let's do it.'' 
 
 They calmly strolled into the warehouse and were greeted by a man who was much less intimidating than Carson's new accomplice. Average height. Shabby beard. Black trench coat. The kind of guy you warn you kids not to take candy from. `` Gentlemen! So nice to see you! And perfectly punctual too. I'm impressed.'' Grinned the inhabitant of the building. 
 `` Fuck off with your small talk and let's get this over with.'' was the growled response. 
 `` Fair enough then,'' Trench coat replied, `` do you have my client's orders?''

 `` My my, you boys certainly are resourceful. Do you mind telling me where you acquired such a thing?'' 
 `` What's it to you?'' Spat the giant. 
 `` Well, quite a lot actually.'' replied Trench Coat as he reached into his pockets and replaced the newly acquired item with a pistol and a badge. `` FBI! You're both under arrest.'' 
 The giant responded with a confused look and muttered, `` Wait, this is n't right...'' as he withdrew his standard issue badge and his expression was returned.

","The shop belonging to my family has been nestled in the `` cozy'' side of the Haunted Wood of El Degeneres for upwards of 700 years now. *683* years to be exact. We barter and trade in all manner of magic, non-magic, cursed, sentient, and otherwise valuable goods. 
 
 I say `` cozy'' because it is the part of the forest in which your soul is n't in danger of being torn apart by wayward storms of dark magic. 
 
 Thank you for making your way to'*Permanently Open*', I know the journey must have been rough. May I interest you in some... *ugh* I ca n't even finish the sentence without rolling my eyes. 
 
 May I interest you in some *cucumber water*? 
 
 The youngsters of the family are on some new kick about supplying fresh *food* and *drink* to our customers. In my adventuring days you had your Lembas bread, and you had water you summoned from the Aqua Plane or you drank from a ditch. We did n't offer *artisanal* holy water for priests, nor organic *grass* for minotaurs, and we sure as hell did n't offer *BAKED GOODS*. 
 
 My families kids from this centuries lineage travel a lot. They've brought back many of the customs from the world outside, and I ca n't help but wonder to myself what kind of insane changes have taken place in *the real world*. 
 
 I have been running this shop for 638 years and I know every product we've ever seen walk into or out of that front door, *and a few products which left out the back*. My old man managed to lose me in the woods one day after the 40th time Ma told him not to lose me in the woods again. I fell into a pond after getting lost which ended up cursing me and now I can not die - *as long as I do n't leave the forest*. 
 
 I was cold, wet, and had lost all my color after pops found me doing my best impression of a plank in the pond. He scooped me up and made for the edge of the forest as quickly as he could, fearing for my life. When we neared a part of the boundary on the perimeter of a clearing and began to step into the sunlight the woods around us began to creak and howl and scream. 
 
 Pa says my body started to convulse and shadows began leaking out of my mouth. Startled, he stumbled a few steps back which caused the woods to chill out and the shadows to claw their way back into my body. He took the long way around. 
 
 Around six centuries later I am still alive, Pa is dead, Mom took off with a Shadow Warlock and lives somewhere in the Twisting Void * ( shes doing well for those who are wondering ) * and I stand inside the shop built by my father and I out of the forest that cursed me. 
 
 Our prices are decent as well. I have had several families over the years and I am lucky enough to be able to monitor the market prices on valuable magic and mighty steel. It's a bit harder to price out the rarer items such as pixie dust and cultist toenails as I have to go and harvest them myself and our shop is one of the few who supply them on a regular basis. 
 
 The inside of'*Permanently Open*' looks like a musty old library had a child with an Apple store and then that child came out as a Yogurt addict and installed a Fro-Yo bar. 
 
 As much as I deride most of the changes the little ones bring before me for the shop it's hard to say no to them. Coming into a line of family members who've all left their mark on the shop, they feel that they need to leave one themselves. 
 
 I am not sure a *dirt bike rental* was the best choice for installation by my great-great-great-great-great-great granddaughters kid, but she listens to my stories so I let her have it unlike her brothers idea for a *vape lounge*. What the hell even is a *vape lounge*? That kid is such a tool. 
 
 Over the years the shop has evolved from a quaint three room * ( armor, weapons, magic ) * to the largest single stop shop in the world, and the second most profitable. The most profitable shop in the world is a dingy little booth ran by a gnome who sells shiny gold *shit* to goblins in exchange for valuable gems. Those goblins will buy *anything* if it has the stink of gold on it, which is easy to achieve for a little rat alchemist like him. That's a trade secret between you and I, traveler. He still comes to my Christmas parties. 
 
 But that's the general gist of how'*Permanently Open*' was created, and why you can buy *+5 Plate Armor* in the same place you can buy cultist toenails, upgrade your cellphone, or check out our out-door out-of-my-sight *Vape Lounge*.

I stood up to welcome her, she took her seat without acknowledgement, leaving me standing alone and awkward, typical. 
 
 I sat. She stared. She glanced at her phone.

14784,"[ WP ] Are you pro or anti magic ? What is your argument on why citizens should or should not deserve a right to magic ?
","`` Now, hear me out on this, but I'm pro magic.'' 
 
 
 Silence falls over everybody assembled. I was n't expecting that much of a reaction. Well, guess there's no avoiding it now. 
 
 
 `` Ever since the year 2072, when mankind uncovered the secrets of the arcane, magic use has spread to the four corners of the Earth. And since that day, when magic was revealed to the world, the question has been: Should citizens have the right to cast magic?'' 
 
 
 I take the opportunity to clear my throat a bit and drink some water. 
 
 
 `` The fact of the matter is that magic can be shaped into offensive spells. Spells that have little purpose aside from hurting others. We hear stories yearly of forest fires starting because idiots forced out a spark of magic from a random stick they brought off the black market while in the middle of a forest. We all know about the Witman Churchill murders, where Mr. Churchill got a hold of a drunk policewizards wand and displayed immense magical talent... before proceeding to use said talent to murder 14 people with spells such as fireball and meteor rain. Then it took 6 policewizards working together to disarm and capture him. 3 of whom died. But need I remind you all that Witman Churchill could have just as easily killed those people with a gun? In fact, unlike a gun a person requires an affinity for offensive spells to cast them with any strength. It was unfortunate that Mr.Churchill had such an affinity, but only 10 % of the population has the affinity to cast offensive magic. A significantly higher 80 % of the population have an affinity for defensive spells such as shields and wards. For the sake of clarity, healing and charm affinities are still higher than offensive magic, at 30 % and 70 % respectively. If civilians had access to magic, it's more likely that they'd be gifted with magic they could use to keep themselves and others safe than magic that they could use to hurt others. Not only that, but we have ways to test what affinity a person has, which allows us to properly register who can cast offensive magic. I'm not saying that they should be treated any differently that another magic caster, only that the standard issue wand should heavily dampen offensive magic, and they're not allowed to use another wand before they receive a proper license to cast. Functionally speaking, there'd be no difference between them and another caster.'' 
 
 
 I prepare to continue my argument before a voice emerges from the crowd. 
 
 
 `` But what do we do about people who have an affinity for multiple magic types? Our tests only show one affinity, and they might take advantage of that to get a non-dampened wand.'' 
 
 
 Ugh, this guy was behind on the times. Well, time to correct him. 
 
 
 `` That was certainly a concern for me, and part of the reason I did n't become pro magic until this year. As it turns out, five years ago some students at the University of Georgia developed a new method of magic testing which is both significantly more accurate and can detect multiple affinities. Just this year, they've released the finished product, and people around the world have been buying them. Which makes your argument a moot point. In any case, how valuable would it be if 30 % of the population could heal wounds with the wave of a wand? It'd save many lives, for sure. Look, I'm just saying that with proper control, magic in the hands of civilians will not be the end of our civilization. Thank you.''

She always says, `` We're like best friends, but we're even closer!'' but I guess I did n't know if I was the only'someone' in her life... 
 
 We were out at the Mall, just going from store to store together window shopping to see what to get her family for the holidays, I could n't visit mine since... Nevermind. 
 
 Anyway, we just spent about three hours there before getting something to eat. McDonald's food tastes way better after you've actually burned off a fraction of the calories before indulging yourself. Our lunchtime conversations were the same as always, we're both fairly outgoing so we get quite animated form time to time. 
 
 After our lunchtime woes of realizing we had spent most of our money, which there was n't much of to begin with, we continued to window shop for something of... Slightly less grandeur. 
 
 I found something for her mom, a nice little hallmark card with little glittery snowflakes on it and some cute letters strung together by some snowmen holding them up eagerly. 
 
 I trotted across the store a little too eagerly to see what, if anything, Michelle had found for her dad. What I saw was, well... 
 
 She was just around the shelf in the corner where I came from, spinning around, I saw her locking lips with some guy... 
 
 He looked kind of like me, I guess. Dark skin, short black hair, nearly six feet... Nah, he was probably taller. I was instantly suspicious, maybe it was someone other than Michelle...? 
 
 No... She shot me a horrified glance, she did n't know who he was either. Maybe she did, but she definitely did not appreciate the gesture.

","`` Followers! Behold! The princess of darkness!'' The Cult Leader announced over the congregation. 
 
 They beckoned me forward and I walked up the steps to the stage. Mystic symbols and binding runes were carved into the walls, floor and even the seats the congregation sat on. At the center of the stage was a giant magic circle surrounded by candles, salt lines and blood runes. I assumed this was where they summoned demons to do their bidding. 
 
 `` Welcome princess! Our prayers have been heard! The devil has sent us his daughter!'' The leader announced. 
 
 `` Actually, we never heard any prayers. I only came because i got your flier.'' I pulled the flier out of my pocket and held it up. 
 
 When one of their recruiters was handing out fliers at my campus i could n't resist coming to see for myself. It was n't everyday i could observe a cult set up around my family. And I was quite surprised when they recognized me when i stepped in, I thought i was relatively unknown to the world. 
 
 `` Oh... but fate has still been kind! We have been graced by the daughter of Lucifer our Lord!'' The leader chanted. 
 
 `` LOL! Lucifer our Lord! LOL!'' The congregation chanted. 
 
 I raised an eyebrow. 
 
 `` Princess? What can YOLO do to earn your favor?'' The leader asked. 
 
 `` Yolo?'' I asked. 
 
 `` YOLO! YOUTH OBEYING LUCIFERS ORDERS! YOLO!'' The congregation raised their hands to the ceiling. 
 
 I tried my hardest to hold back a laugh. 
 
 `` Yes! YOLO! for Satan's wishes are granted!'' The leader explained. 
 
 `` SWAG! SATAN'S WISHES ARE GRANTED! SWAG!'' The congregation chanted. 
 
 I tried to smile a respectfully as possible, `` I'm sorry... We do n't really grant favor or power anymore.'' 
 
 `` But we should be rewarded, we worship the fallen!'' 
 
 `` WTF! WORSHIP THE FALLEN! WTF!'' 
 
 `` Really, we're closed for business. But it was a nice gesture with the pentagrams and all.'' I explained. 
 
 Without warning the leader stepped forward and pushed me onto the magic circle at the center of the stage. I felt the demonic binding ritual wrap around me as the runes began to glow. 
 
 `` Then we shall take your power! Rise our father Lucifer!'' The leader chanted. 
 
 `` ROFL! RISE OUR FATHER LUCIFER! ROFL!'' The congregation chanted. 
 
 I should have been angry, but i was too amused at their incompetence. I could have easily broken the circle, or sang a song of death to kill them all but instead i rolled over and put my hands behind my head. I rested for a couple of minutes as i waited. I felt my power being drained slightly but i was n't at all worried. 
 
 Dad appeared with a pitchfork in hand and saw his daughter lying at the center of demon draining magic circle surrounded by the cult. It did n't take him long to figure out what was happening. 
 
 `` Lucifer our Lord!'' The leader called out. 
 
 `` LOL! Lucifer our Lord! LOL!'' The congregation chanted.

11365,"[ WP ] You are a supervillain named The Keymaster . Instead of creating grand plans to conquer the world , all you do is run around and free other captured supervillains from prison , after the superheroes defeat them .
","Joe Warshborn pulled out a set of keys from a secret compartment in the trash can. There was hundreds of them, all tinkling and shimmering in the dim lighting. The metallic clink they made calmed his nerves. He never knew what to expect with the new villains. The keys were his weapons, though. 
 
 He eyed ball the man behind the bars. Water streamed down the walls around a tall and heavy chested figure. Strong legs lounged in front of him without a care as the villain eye balled the scruffy man back. He seemed confused. 
 
 `` So who are you?'' He sneered at Joe's janitor's uniform, but seemed interested in the keys. They are always interested in the keys. Joe walked past their cells a hundred times, but they only seem to notice he existed when he pulled out the keys. Even then, they only pay attention to the keys. The villain's eyes never focused on his face. Which is what Joe preferred in these type of situations. 
 
 The janitor grimaced and started fiddling through the keys. He did n't often come out this way, so finding the right key took a few more seconds. His tired eyes looked up, and he scratched his scraggly beard. He held up the correct key in satisfaction so the villain could see. `` They call me The Keymaster.'' 
 
 `` Are you a villain?'' 
 
 He shook my head, and quietly unlocked the heavy door. `` No, I just release them.'' 
 
 `` Why? You a hero then?'' 
 
 Joe noted the red flames shimmering almost invisible on the villain's skin and backed away prudently. That explains why he was in the back rooms, and the walls of water. Less flammable that way. 
 
 `` Nope. Just a neutral party. You are free to go, and I suggest you head out quickly. There are cameras who will notice there is a missing body.'' Joe waved vaguely towards the exit. 
 
 The fire man hesitated, but freedom always took precedence with villains. Flames bursted in preparation in his hands as he jogged turn the corridor. Joe sighed and pushed his cleaning cart in the opposite direction, shaking his head in disappointment. Kids these days never said thanks anymore. 
 
 The wheels squeaked pleasantly in the dim lighting and soon he heard the sirens call into the night. They knew the fire man was gone. Not his problem though. He still had to clean the guards bathroom before calling it a night, and dispose of the trash. 
 
 As Joe stepped into the bathroom, he heard a polite cough from the back. One of the newer interns from The League of Awesome Heroes stood awkwardly next to the stalls. Joe stopped, and looked expectedly at him. 
 
 The young hero posed dramatically. `` Uhm, good citizen! Are you the man known as Keymaster?'' 
 
 Joe glanced around the empty bathroom, down at his janitors uniform, and back at the awkwardly confident man. `` I can neither confirm nor deny that.'' 
 
 This seemed to deflate the hero's enthusiasm. `` Oh, well, okay. I have a package for you. The Keymaster. Which is you. Right?'' 
 
 The janitor shrugged amicably and held out his hand, `` Let's just say I am not surprised to see you here.'' 
 
 With a sniff, the hero dumped the package down onto Joe's wrinkled palm and unceremoniously dove out the window. Joe carefully weighed the package, and nodded approvingly. Another two years of this, he should be able to retire. 
 
 With a whistle, the Keymaster began mopping down the floors.

Unfortunately, he was actually about to buy mine. The blade of my knife made a slight *snick* as I opened it. The weapon was hidden to my side, out of view. The dealer was starting to get frustrated. Perhaps it was the faraway look in my eyes, or the way I held my hand to one side, just out of his sight. Either way, he started to withdraw slightly, taking a step back.

","Queens. 
 
 New York. It was young Don's home, his pride: with his father, they'd *built* this town. 
 
 Literally all of it. 
 
 Don coughed, grinding out the butt of his cigarette against the cold-basement concrete. These days, they knew better. These days, smoking killed. Don snorted, but the ironic humor fell flat. 
 
 Queens was a place of secrets, but... what *was* he looking at? He'd grown up here, in this building, from babe to virile, puissant man. 
 
 `` I did n't pay to build *this*,'' Don mused aloud. *Or, I would n't have, if I actually paid for anything... * He smiled, thankful for his business acumen and extraordinary talent. 
 
 Young Don climbed to the bottom of his basement stairs, walking forward under the wan light of an incandescent bulb. 
 
 Somehow, a great, pillared, stone-arched building- which seemed to open up *into* the ground itself- had been found in his childhood basement. The gilding service ( which, by the way, would be made fully aware of Don's displeasure ) had informed him of a delay due to the `` greater surface area than expected, requiring more gold.'' Don had n't been home since he had become a successful businessman- shortly after his stint as a fetus- and he figured it was time. 
 
 Well. Whoever had constructed a building under- and, indeed, *adjoining* with Don's childhood home should know that young Don considered squatting to be one of the cardinal sins: up there with income tax, rent control, and sweet potatoes. 
 
 Don walked across his basement and up to the building. A chill air which smelled oh-so-slightly of a cool, Siberian summer rolled over him. He closed his eyes, lost in a reverie, so sweet, so beautiful- 
 
 He nearly tripped, as he'd closed his eyes for a moment too long. Had the *gravity* changed? Though the entrance was thrust into the ground at an angle, Don now walked on its floor normally. The entire building was one great, circular room. It had a high ceiling, and at its center, there burnt a great fire. 
 
 It lacked an obvious source of fuel. 
 
 *Gas? * Don wondered. To burn such a fire would cost a fortune. 
 
 Perhaps he *had* build this place? In fact, he vaguely- no, *distinctly* remembered it. 
 
 Yes, this place was his. 
 
 Don walked around it, admiring the furnishings his decorator had used. *Fantastic*. A shimmering axe... A sword with a ruby in its hilt... Even a long-barreled rifle. Somehow, along the round edge of the room, these items were suspended in air. 
 
 `` They're beautiful, are n't they?'' 
 
 Don jumped in alarm. Someone was in his home! He puffed his chest, and spun, and... *paused. * 
 
 It was a woman. She was tall, young, and had sharp, well-proportioned features of the sort a man might sculpt. Her bosom was generous, and her hips swayed as she walked. 
 
 On the whole, Don figured, she was slightly better than plain. 
 
 Don walked towards her. Naturally, he reached down to, well, *you know*, but to his utter disbelief, she stepped away. 
 
 `` *Now*, now, Donald.'' 
 
 `` You know my name?'' Young Don asked. 
 
 `` I know a great many things, Donald.'' 
 
 `` I *doubt* that,'' Don muttered under his breath. But when he met the woman's eyes, suddenly, she *changed*. She was no longer a woman: she was a man, with marbled skin. With a forked tail which spoke of power. 
 
 `` Donald, do you know who I am?'' 
 
 ``... yes? Yes, I do,'' Young Don lied. It did n't matter- it was another man, with whom Don could speak business. 
 
 `` Good, Donald. Good.'' The marbled man flicked his tail, smiling, waving his arm around the room. `` These are all weapons, Donald. They have been wielded by the strongest, most impressive men ever to live. Would you like to wield one for me, Donald?'' 
 
 Don cleared his throat. `` Yes... please,'' Don replied, politely. Meanwhile, he glanced around the room. Hungry. 
 
 `` Then... choose,'' the marbled man said. 
 
 Don began to walk forward, but the marbled man held his hand aloft. `` No. *It* will choose *you*.'' 
 
 Young Don rolled his eyes, but waited. And then, he felt drawn... pulled, towards a hovering weapon which had before eluded his attention. 
 
 Don walked up to it, *knowing* that it was his, feeling anticipation for the powerful manhood it would help him wield... 
 
 But, upon inspection, Don nearly choked. `` You think to *scam* me?!'' He turned to the marbled man, raising his voice, angry. `` A piano-sized bowling ball? It's covered in dust, it's useless!'' 
 
 The marbled man raised an eyebrow. `` Donald, it is covered in dust because it has seen... too little use. But it is my prized weapon, Donald. I wish to give it to you.'' 
 
 Don scratched his head. `` I... I... Can I have the axe instead?'' Donald sighed, confused. `` Please? It's... so shiny...'' 
 
 `` Donald, that... *bowling ball*... is worth a million axes. It will split the fabric of the atom itself, and via fission and fusion, it will bring cleansing to a world filled with too many who are *different than you*... And Donald, I will give you more than *four thousand* of them.'' 
 
 Donald sighed. He just did n't understand. `` But how?'' He asked. 
 
 `` Simple,'' the marbled man replied. `` I will make you the President... of the United States of America.''

 Our lips crashed together with the force of many suns. I could feel her warmth radiating against me. It almost felt like a dream. Her hair was the physical representation of soft in its most natural and raw form. After what felt like a thousand years, I felt her begin to pull away from the kiss and I followed suit. “ Today was quite lovely with you, my sweet. ” She admitted. speaking in her smooth as honey voice. “ Yes, it was. You looked absolutely stunning in that little dress. Anyways, it has been a long day, and I do believe it ’ s time for you to get back to your humble abode, Brooklynn. ” I spoke gently and I smiled softly at her. She blushed at the use of her whole name, and reached her arm over and opened the door of the vehicle. “ I can ’ t wait to see you tomorrow. ” She exclaimed while slowly getting out of the car. She closed it behind her, and I smiled as she proceeded to her own car, and eventually got in after fumbling with her keys for a moment. 
 
 
 Pulling into my driveway, I sighed. I almost hated coming home every day, but I had to keep my mask glued tight. I shifted into park, and reached behind my steering wheel to fetch my keys. I fumbled for a moment before twisting and pulling my keys out, and I slipped them into my pockets. I opened the door of my car and reached over to the passenger side seat and retrieved my suitcase. I made a slight adjustment to my suit and tie after I had gotten out of the car, and I looked over myself through a mirror I had stored in my briefcase. Nothing to bad. I took a very deep breath just before I opened the door to my house. “ Ah, for fuck sake. Who the hell locks the door at 5:43?! ” I mumbled into my head as I had to set down my briefcase and reach into my pocket for my keys. As I pulled my keys out, I heard the door quickly unlock and open. I silently sighed to myself and slid my keys back into my pocket. I picked up my briefcase and I could see my wife, Amber, standing there with a half smile. “ Hey, sugarbun. ” She said, in a tone that absolutely annoyed me. “ Mask, ” I thought to and even mentally chastised myself for the slight mistake I had made. I slapped the fakest smile on my face possible, and wrapped my arms around her in a pretty half-assed hug. “ I missed you. ” I lied. I pulled away from the hug and placed my briefcase down against the wall, trying not to show my irritation towards everything she does. I undid my tie and threw it into my room as I passed by it, and walked my way into the kitchen, with Amber following close behind me. “ So, Brooklynn, huh? ” She said in her god awful accent. As I made my way into the kitchen further, there was black and white pictures of a few of the places me and Brooklynn had “ met up ” at. She had them all over the table and counters, and I didn ’ t really know what to say. I wasn ’ t hurt at all, more surprised that she had expected anything. I ran my fingers through my hair and took a deep breath and turned around, only to be met with a slap to the face, and for Amber ’ s nails to be imbedded deep into my face. Now, THAT hurt. My face stung as she became increasingly teary eyed. I kicked her to the ground roughly, covering my face with one hand as I knelt down and seen her crying now. “ Yeah, Brooklynn. The lady that is superior to you in each, and every god damn way. Fucking filth, you are. ” I started to release my anger on her. Punch after punch, tears and blood mixing together in a senseless fit of rage and testosterone. After a few minutes, I got up. I went to rinse off my hands and change into new clothes. Realizing how bad she had gotten my face, I went to the bathroom to get some alcohol to pour on my face. I did what was necessary and eventually bandaged my face. With the rage and emotions flowing through my body, I started to walk and attempt to leave the house. I walked by Amber, seeing her blood stain the floor, I laughed. She was sitting there, crying and murmuring unintelligible things. I stepped over her body and walked to the front door, opened it, walked down the pavement and got into my car and left. 
 
 
 I had all four windows of my car down, going as fast as I legally could down the freeway. The wind felt good on my skin, which felt as hot as volcanic ash. Eventually I began to cool down, but I didn ’ t know what to do. I decided to drive by Brooklyn's house. I couldn ’ t stay here. I messaged her on our secret accounts and we met on the block of her street. I told her what happened, and that I needed to leave. She said she couldn ’ t go with me, and that… That hurt. I begged her, but she said she had been doubting our relationship for a long time and finally felt it was time for her to be loyal to her boyfriend. “... Are you sure, Brooke? ” I choked out, while trying not to let my emotions flood me. “ Yes, Jason. I ’ m sure. I ’ m sorry… ” She looked into my eyes as I said it, and I realized she was trying to be happy in a better way. I let her go, and decided to drive to a hotel a few miles away under a different name. As I was laying down, I felt a stinging heat across my chest. It grew hotter and hotter until I was forced out of my bed and ran to the bathroom while taking my shirt off. I stared at the mirror in awe, as it read Amber in a crimson red metallic color. “ I… I didn ’ t kill her! She was alive when I left her! This is a mistake… ” I whispered into the palms of my hand as I slid down against the cold tiles of the bathroom. “ No… No. This has to be a terrible nightmare… My life has become a nightmare. ” I insisted to myself, and I thought I ’ d go to bed and it would all be over. I ran over to my bed and covered myself up, and fell quickly asleep. 
 
 
 I woke up in a haze of blurryness and confusion. I pulled my covers off my bed and I nearly cried at the sight of the tauntingly blood colored words. My god… I had killed her. I beat her to death. I ’ m… I ’ m a murderer. I couldn ’ t believe it. I reached my right arm up to wipe some tears off of my arm, and realized another name written on my arm. 
 
 
 Junior. 
 How weird, I had thought… Until I realized that Amber always wanted to name her first boy with the name of Junior.

Maybe life had some sort of sentimental value to those people, or maybe, charity was just a great ego-boost. It did n't matter in the end, though. The unsure appeals to hope and shout-outs to Christ, after the realization that they'd just fall on deaf ears, stopped. The misguided attempts would start up again, only to be drowned out by the random snippets of conversation by other passerby. 
 `` JESUS! JUST FUCKING JUMP ALREADY IF YOU ’ RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN?'' Screamed an increasingly annoyed man, who was just trying to share his own shout-y version of the gospel a few minutes ago. 
 This sentiment was repeated, recited in the faces the gathering crowd. 
 As more and more time lapsed, the man's leather jacket became his only friend. The only thing protecting him from the howling wind that threatened his composure. 
 `` Ah em.'' Clearing his voice: a strict juxtaposition to the uneasy silence. 
 He averted his eyes upwards towards a cloudy, gray sky—yet somehow they still delighting in the nonexistent rays which burnt images and geometric patterns into his retinas. 
 `` He said to them: Go!'' 
 Bottles of Blueberry vodkas and iPhones: were dropped for the first time. The whole herd rushed down the towards the water. Each, making a point of not getting too close to the man. The water soon became red, and he laughed as he walked back onto the bridge. 
 Once the job was done, he trudged along the middle of the road, knowing that no vehicle could hurt him. The man would slow his pace occasionally to scoff at the survivors, whose were maimed bodies wrapped around railings indicated an obviously desperate attempt to subvert the `` mind control.'' 
 `` Please... please...'' it trailed off, then rebounded...'' please...'' 
 The words were cut off, but he was sure the end was: `` kill me.'' 
 That cry resounded from every direction, inevitably dying out after some time. It was n't always the same voice, or the same words—but the sentiment that constantly lead to trough-inspired scuffles, resonated with each scream… 
 The Bystanders knew they were a witness to something…something they had always feared. 
 He finally made it to the end of the bridge, leading into a mountainside tunnel, and could n't help but smirk when he saw the graffiti: 
 
 New World Order. 
 
 It has begun…

","`` Wait up, Mandy,'' she whispered under her breath, her footsteps clapping against the wet paving stones. I heard her call out, but I did n't dare break my stride or turn around looking. I did slow my pace though, ever so slightly, and soon the familiar sound of her footsteps fell in beside mine. 
 
 `` I love when it rains like this.'' I did n't turn to look, but I could hear her smile in the words. And such a smile it was. Soft around the edges, with a genuine touch of warmth, and perked up at one corner. She shared her smile with everyone, from teachers to classmates, but it always seemed wider when it was pointed at me. But still I did n't turn to see it. 
 
 `` You know this is a bad place.'' I said to the back of the girl in front of me. I watched as her black woollen jacket swish across the top of black boots, and tried not to think of last night. I could feel my cheeks heating up regardless beneath the cold rain, determined not to look back least someone noticed me blushing. `` The citadel is right behind us,'' I reminded her, `` We're in plain sight out here.'' 
 
 `` But that's the best part,'' She said lightly, `` Let them look out here, and you know what they'll see?'' She paused to let me jump in. 
 
 `` Just a sea of black umbrellas.'' She finished, nonplussed by my silence. And now my feet did miss a step at the implications. I tripped on the stones, sending papers flying to the flooded sidewalk. 
 
 Biting back tears, I scrambled for the papers before the rain soaked them through, snatching them out from the unyielding paths of black boots. When the last soggy assignment was shoved into my bag, I glanced about for my umbrella. A hand held it out over my rain-drenched head as it's partner offered me a boost. Her warm smile greeted me, shielded from prying eyes by her own black umbrella. I took her hand cautiously, like one might take a live wire, and she pulled me to my feet. And if that grip lingered a moment or two too long beneath the watchful eyes of the citadel, then no one could see a face as we scurried back to the crowd. Just two nameless black figures, huddled against wind and rain.

 `` They're undead. They're falling apart, man. It's completely gross to look at one.'' 
 
 `` And you... created these things in your lab?'' 
 
 Jamie looked toward the floor. Both of his hands were on the diner table, tightening slightly. After a few moments pause he gave a quick nod. 
 
 `` So... I dunno man. Beer stealing creatures of the undead does n't scream *zombie* to me. Where's the terror? The apocalypse? Brad Pitt doing impossible feats while still maintaining perfect hair?''

 Leon looked around at the mostly empty tavern. Jamie's outburst had caused a few of the heads to turn their way. Leon shot then a small apologetic smile.

288,"[ WP ] The ancient dragon , nearing his end , takes a moment to reflect upon his long life .
","The sun had just set over an inconspicuous cave that was soon to be the final resting place of an ancient, majestic creature. Never to be remembered, never to be praised, he humbly picked this spot for a simple reason. He could clearly see the skies above him while his, now greatly weakened, body lay still close to the cave entrance. 
 
 `` Thousands of times I have gazed upon the heavens'', he thought to himself silently, `` but the skies above never seemed so clear, the stars so bright. I have never had much time to look up I suppose. There was work to be done, a world to be built. I did n't question the duty assigned to me by an invisible but omnipresent force that I never met but always felt as it inspired my actions. It is what drove me forward to finish what I have started ages ago. I never thought what the end would look like. Not while I flew high above this new world, never ignoring a single gust of wind under my wings. I will miss flight. The incredible feeling when you rise above the ground, watching your shadow grow smaller and smaller below. I never thought of the end as I watched mountains rise and oceans fill. It took countless years for them to settle to their current size and place. The waves... I will miss them too. The sound of waves breaking around me while I rested on the shore. Not even now, as I feel the void slowly engulf what remains of me do I think of the end. I think of the stars, the ones that shone long before I came to the world, and the ones that will remain in the skies long after I am gone. How many others are out there, I ca n't help but wonder? Others like me, my brothers whom I will never meet, busy turning their own chaotic worlds into something good. The stars remain with me, stalwart to the end, the only ones to witness the last few breaths that I will ever draw. Seems only fair, I suppose. 
 The night is at its darkest at last. The moment I've been waiting for. Finally, the time has come for me to do a last act of service for this world I grew so fond of. I never imagined what the end would look like. I was born immortal, after all. I was never told this by anyone, I just felt it. Felt that I could not die except by choice. I could live forever if I wanted to. Eternal life sounded more tempting with each passing moment, but no. I have made my choice. I will sacrifice my immortality to bring them into this world. I hope that they will use the gift of life well. I hope that they will look up to the stars every now and then. 
 Stars. I will miss them most of all...'' 
 
 As the first rays of sun shone in the skies, the first man set foot on earth. Oblivious to the fact that an ancient presence has left this world only moments before, he strode forward towards an emergence of a new race. It was the way of the universe. From death came life, and the cycle will go on and on. Many more will perish only to be replaced by others. Others that no one but the stars will remember.

6112,"[ WP ] A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words -- Literally . All world currency has been replaced by the spoken word .
","At a certain point in human history communication became repetitive and basic. Two schools of thought emerged- the liberal left wanted communication to become ever further developed and to become even more intermeshed into society, while an intensely conservative right wanted to conserve the'sanctity of language' by preventing it's perversion into ever more buzzy articles and slang degradation. 
 
 For years an international parliament debated, and in 2057 the conservative right had gained traction after a year marked by multiple world leaders butchering public speeches and were accused of being too lax with their words. 
 
 The THOUSAND act was drafted a year later, and it's implementation was simple. The act initially converted every dollar or unit of currency into the ability to communicate 10 seconds of speech. Implementation was a bitch; new monitoring systems had to be created in the form of software that wrote into the preexisting mental chips that 90 % of the populace already had. Many critiques called the act an abomination and an invasion of free speech. But the general public accepted the act as a way to help restore the respect towards the spoken word.

6516,"[ WP ] A simple , classic fairy tale
","Once upon a time, in the low lands, all the animals lived quite serenely, for they played and hunted and lived. All the animals, that is, save Snake. 
 
 Snake was long and brown and his yellow eyes pierced the other animals and they shunned him. 
 
 `` You crawl in the dirt all day,'' said Hare, `` so dirt you are!'' 
 
 Snake resented his nature. It was true, he could n't deny it. Horse ran on all fours; Hawk flew in the air, noble, over the others; even the lazy Toad hopped and swam. 
 
 `` It is not so bad!'' cried Slug. `` You can be friends with me.'' 
 
 Snake was unimpressed. He did n't want to be friends with Slug, the slimy clout, he wanted to be with the other animals. One night, when the moon was full, Snake awoke, his yellow eyes shining like two pins creasing the black, and he hatched and formulated a plan. 
 
 The following day, Cow was walking peacefully down the rolling hills when she saw a whole cluster of animals, gathering around. She went over to the group to see what they were gawking at. 
 
 They were saying things like: `` Amazing!'' and `` Splendid!'' and `` How did you do that?'' 
 
 So Cow pushed through the crowd and was amazed to see Snake in the middle, showing off his beautiful black new wings. `` Why, Snake!'' she said. `` They are so elegant.'' 
 
 `` Thank you,'' Snake said. `` They really are, are n't they?'' 
 
 None of the animals noticed that Raven, however, was missing. 
 
 The following day, another crowd had gathered around Snake. Not only did his beautiful black wings have a particularly lovely sheen that day, but he now had four delightful, strong legs, white, and furry. Again, the animals cried in delight and pleasure, and they all played together, Snake running and hopping behind, occasionally soaring, and hissing with pleasure. 
 
 And no one noticed Hare was gone. 
 
 The third day, Snake was larger. Much larger. Not only did he have his black wings and his furry feet, he was now almost as large as Dog, and he had antlers sprouting out of his head like Deer. The animals looked at each other disconcertingly. Something was, indeed, very wrong. 
 
 `` We must to something about Snake!'' cried Pig. 
 
 `` Easy. We will eat him,'' said Bear. 
 
 `` Nonsense. You could never catch him,'' remarked Eagle, `` For he flies and jumps far too quickly.'' 
 
 They argued and bickered for ages until a small *harumph! * came from the corner. They turned, and Cat was there, licking her paw. She looked at them all with a grin and large, emphatic eyes. `` I have a plan.'' 
 
 Snake was delighted to find out that he had been invited to the animal's finest picnic - held, naturally, in his honor. He had just finished adding some lovely fins - oh the waters he could swim in now! - and he was in a spectacularly good mood. He flew over to the field beside the river, and was surprised to find no one there. 
 
 He frowned. `` Hello?'' But there was no response. Afar, he saw a mound of food, filled with pastries and cheeses and all sorts of delights, and his long tongue began drooling, and he hopped over. 
 
 Suddenly, the ground beneath him fell, and he plopped down into a small hole far, far below. When he tried flying, it did no good, for there was not enough room for him to spread his wings. 
 
 `` Let me out!'' he yelled. 
 
 Cat grinned down over the hole. `` See you in a long time, friend,'' she said, and purred with a particularly sardonic twinge. 
 
 Two weeks later, the animals gathered round the hole. In it was a very angry Snake, and just a snake, with no wings, nor legs, nor fins, beside an old, desiccated, abandoned snake skin, full of all those things. He hissed and cried. 
 
 Snake never took anyone's parts again, and the animals whose bits had been stolen had soon been found ( under the roots of an old tree, constricted and bound ), and their parts replaced. Snake slid through the dirt, and he eyed the other animals from the dirt and the ground and he hissed some more. He was rather a solitary animal since then. 
 
 The end.

","“ If I keep getting up to do chores, I am going to lose this weight. How can I be a jolly fat man when I have to take the trash 200 yards to the dumpster through this snow storm 3 times a day? ” 
 
 Santa Claus was grumpy today, but Mrs. Claus was used to his moods. Her rebuttal came out faster than a striking snake, “ You were fat 50 pounds ago. If you keep putting on weight, we are going to need more reindeer this year. Since you insist on three organic fresh cooked meals per day, there is a lot of trash. If you want to cook for yourself, I would be happy to take the heaps of trash to the bin. Lord knows I need the peace and quiet almost as much as you need the exercise. ” 
 
 They had done this dance so many times that neither of them were upset by the exchange. Santa laughed and picked up his little red phone. They could hear his voice over the loud speaker in the elf quarters across the snow covered yard. “ A 30 minute break on Christmas eve to the first four of you lazy cretins at the front door. ” 
 
 Ten seconds later, there was a thundering roar outside as thousands of little feet bolted for Santa ’ s door. Breaks on Christmas Eve were the most coveted prizes on the North Pole. Santa looked out the window at the carnage with a smirk on his face. He opened the door and selected his victims. The remaining elves slowly slunk back to their building cursing their faster brethren for stealing the break out from under them. 
 
 Santa heaved two outrageously humongous bags of trash at the four winners. They knew the trip to the trash would take them several hours and that they risked freezing to death in the cold. But the prize was too good. A 30 minute break during the last 24 hours of the Christmas slog almost guaranteed that they would survive. Until then, they would be treated like celebrities. Every elf would trade anything for the chance at one of those breaks. 
 
 The four elves finished the garbage drop about 3 hours later and very late at night. As usual for this type of “ favor ”, they were required to check in with Santa to confirm completion. When they knocked on the door, Mrs. Claus answered and handed them their break coupons. Exhausted, they returned to their bunks to sleep for the remainder of their one day off for the month. It was hard being an elf, but today they smiled and felt like kings.

","“ It started when I was six. At least, that ’ s when I first noticed it. You get this feeling, as it ’ s happening, you see. That ’ s how I always knew it was still, how I was still... me. That feeling never changed, it never has. ” 
 
 “ So you were six years old. What happened that first time? ” 
 
 “ I was with my sister, playing on the side of the street near our house. There was this great big dip in the road, you know, from all the winters and cars and things, so when it rained, it would puddle into this little pond. We used to take little boats and toys, my sister and I, and we would float them in the pond and pretend it was the ocean and we were giant sea monsters. She was eight at the time. I used to like to sit with my back towards the road so I could see the house while we played. My mother used to always come bring us hot chocolate when it was cold, so I would face the house so I could see when she was coming. That day was different. When we ran outside to play, I got this weird feeling. It felt weird at the time, but I think it was just because I didn ’ t really know what it was, you see. Really it ’ s the only thing that feels comfortable to me now. ” 
 
 “ So what did you do? ” 
 
 “ Nothing really, I just kind of shook it off; figured it was the cold or something. I continued over to the puddle, but this time I sat on the sidewalk instead, facing the street. I didn ’ t really think about it at all, it just happened. It had rained particularly hard the day before so the puddle was especially large, and my sister took my spot at the far end in the street. The roads were pretty slick, and I think by the time he saw her it was just too late. It ’ s a little fuzzy after that, but I remember the screeching. It was so loud and I just remember that weird feeling, in my gut. It was so strong that first time, it felt so warm. I remember my mother running out of the house screaming, and I was sad because she dropped the hot chocolate. ” 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry. That must have been really hard for you. ” 
 
 “ It should have been. ” 
 
 “ What do you mean? ” 
 
 “ I used to think that the reason I didn ’ t feel anything after was because of some repressed memories or psychiatric, emotional bullshit; but I know better now. You feed off of it. The feeling, the warm sensation. It ’ s like nothing you ’ ll ever feel. Like no sensation you ’ ll ever experience. ”

It didn ’ t have to be severe or anything, you know. Someone trips on a crack, gets mud splashed on them by a car, that kind of thing. But the big ones, those were when you could really feel it. Feel it like a rush through you, and all your blood gets warm, and you can kind of feel the things around you. I knew a few people at my company, superiors and bosses and such, who got cancer, but that was less exhilarating. The best times were when it was sudden, and everything would change in a matter of seconds, you know? ” 
 
 “ So this feeling, you felt it with everything from tragedies to spilled coffee? ” 
 
 “ That ’ s what I thought at first. I thought there was something inside of me that could just sense others ’ misfortunes. But that ’ s not how it works. It ’ s not about them. It ’ s about me. It ’ s always been about me. ” 
 
 “ Wha – what do you mean? ” 
 
 “ The heart attack was my favorite. The CEO just dropped dead on the table in the middle of a presentation. I could see it in his face right before it happened. I felt it. And now I have his job. If it wasn ’ t such a tragedy for the company, they would have said I was the luckiest person alive. Everyone would have been sending me congratulation cards. I sent myself one. I deserved it. ” 
 
 “ You? You did all that? ” 
 
 “ No, no. It wasn ’ t me. They all just happened. But eventually, the thrill became greater than the results. I would gamble billions against others, risk entire bankruptcy just to see competitors fail and my company rise. I seek it out, you see. I ’ m not doing anything, I ’ m just lucky. And the luckier I get, the more... unlucky others get. Luck is like money. It ’ s finite. You can ’ t have too much or it depreciates. It ’ s traded back and forth, exchanged for cars and mansions and pretty wives. And I have it all. I have all the money and all the luck. It ’ s mine. It ’ s mine by birthright. ” 
 
 “ Mr. Lucy, this has been a fascinating interview but I really must go now. ” 
 
 “ Oh, so soon? I haven ’ t even told you about the earthquake that got me on the Board of Directors. ” 
 
 She quickly gathered her things and began to leave. “ I must inform you that this was all on the record Mr. Lucy, ” she said darkly. 
 
 “ Actually, as a matter of fact, ” he said, “ I ’ m getting that feeling right now. ” 
 
 As she rushed out of the room with her recorder, the man smiled coyly and said “ Don ’ t trip on your way down the stairs. It ’ s an awfully long fall. ”

3599,"[ WP ] An angel and a demon walk into a bar ...
","She was n't very tall, maybe about five and a half foot or so. She had a shape like an hourglass, curves where it mattered most. When she walked, she had this way about her, like a movie star that was used to being treated to the finer things in life. When she talked, her voice belonged in a choir, and it made every male pair of eyes turn to stare at her. She wore a long white coat that went below her knees, and a pair of white and green striped leggings that ended with a pair of matching white low-heeled shoes. She tossed her long blonde hair to one side when she made her way to the bar. I took a long draw from my beer, debating whether I'd go over and say hi, but it would n't matter in the end. My long black leather duster swayed a little in the breeze when she opened the door, and I pulled it closed. 
 
 She caught my glance and pursed her ruby lips in a pout, judging me from head to toe. I did n't think twice about it as I finished my first drink with a loud gulp and a louder burp. She gave me a disgusted look befoe turning back to the bartender. He was leaning back against the wall behind him, arms crossed over his chest, obviously enjoying the silent treatment she was giving me. She cleared her throat before she spoke. 
 
 `` Excuse me, sir, I'm looking for a man --'' 
 
 `` Well lady, I think you found that.'' I muttered under my breath as the bartender slid me another cold frosted mug. Her head whipped to face me so fast I thought she might snap her neck clean off. 
 
 `` Pardon you, sir, but this truley is none of your concern.'' Like I said, she had a soft voice, but man she used it like a knife. I shrugged a little and gave her the warmest smile I could pull together. 
 
 `` Maybe it is my concern, ma'am. Does n't seem like this is your kind of place to be looking for companionship.'' I glanced toward the tables to my left, where every size and shape of scum and villainy had eyeballs on us. `` But that's not what you're after here, now is it?'' 
 
 `` And what do you know about what I'm'after', sir?'' There were those knives again. `` Perhaps you would better serve society by being constructive instead of imbibing your pathetic nights away into oblivion.'' 
 
 She hand her hands on her hips in a way that I had n't seen in a good long time, and I nodded towards the bartender. `` How about a drink for the lady, Bart? On me, of course.'' 
 
 `` Hrmph.'' I was surprised she did n't protest, but something about her was making my brain itch in a way I'd not felt in well over forty years. She settled down pertly on the stool next to mine and put both of her hands palm down on the bar. `` I'll take three shots of your best Bacardi, please.'' 
 
 The bartender, Bart, had them in front of her faster than I could drain my beer, but it still was n't as fast as she downed them in rapid succession before slamming them onto the wooden bar with a loud clang. There were a couple of low whistles behind me, and even a few slow claps, but none of that fazed me. I'd seen plenty of folks of her type before. 
 
 `` Not bad,'' I chuckled, sliding over a twenty to Bert that he stuffed quickly away in a shirt pocket. `` Last time I seen someone do that, it ended in a fistfight.'' 
 
 `` I do not condone violence,'' she said haughtily. `` The O'Keefes do not engage in such dullery.'' 
 
 I smiled the best smile I could muster. `` O'Keefe, eh? The ones that own the oil fields 35 miles west of Dallas? Yeah, that's about what I figured, but you're a long way from home, miss. What brings you off your heavenly perch to dwell among the lesser beings?'' 
 
 `` My name,'' she sneered, `` is Diane. And I am looking for a man by the name of Daryl Worth. He was to meet me at 1PM sharp to discuss important business matters. Personal business matters.'' 
 
 I smiled even wider, pushing the brim of my hat up a bit to study her clean, pale face more clearly. For being the middle of June it was unusually clear of sweat, and she had this scent of berries I had n't smelled in so long it made my mouth water. `` Business matters? That's a funny way of saying you had a date. I'm not judging you,'' I said before she could retort, `` since you have your reasons. I tell you what, I'll help you find this Daryl. What's he look like?'' 
 
 Diane narrowed her eyes suspiciously at me. `` He's about your height and build, looks to be around his mid twenties or thirties, clean-shaved, straight brown hair tied in a ponytail behind his head. He should be wearing a red plaid shirt and black khakis.'' 
 
 `` Oh? Hmm, now where have I seen that description before...'' I gave her a playful smile and she looked ready to kill. `` My mind's kind of fuzzy, but I tell you what, let's go for a walk. I'm sure we'll bump into him eventually. Fresh air will clear my head. Oh, and there's a nice little ice cream place just around the corner that he might be at. Let's go check it out.'' 
 
 Diane folded her arms over her chest as I heard the bartender choke off a laugh behind me. `` Why on earth would I ever want to go anywhere with someone as obviously uneducated and filthy as you? I can find him on my own. Oh, and thanks for the drink.'' 
 
 I heard her swear under her breath as she marched out the door. I thought Bart was going to die from how hard he was biting back the laughter. After she disappeared out that door, he let loose the loudest guffaw that was echoed by everyone else in the place. He put a hand on my shoulder as he kept laughing, and I simply shrugged and turned back to finish my drink. `` God damn, talk about dodging a bullet. What a complete bitch!'' Bart was still laughing as he gave me an apologetic pat on the shoulder. `` She's probably going to get lost trying to track down --'' 
 
 `` I'll go find her,'' I interrupted him, setting my mug and another twenty on the bar. Bert stared at me in disbelief as I pulled my hat off and ran my fingers through my thick brown hair all the way back to the pony tail. I pulled the black leather duster off to set it on the barstool, and straightened my favorite plaid red shirt, careful not to spill my drink on my good pants. `` Would n't do to let someone like that wind up in the wrong part of town. Liable to get robbed, or worse.'sides, I still want that ice cream.'' 
 
 `` Man, I do n't get you,'' Bart said, shaking his head. `` That's the fifth one this week. What do you see in those high class gals, Daryl?'' 
 
 I grinned as I swung my feet off the barstool and headed towards the door. 
 
 `` Everything good that they do n't even see in themselves, Bart.''

","The golden light pouring from the sky seeped into the cityscape below. The oozing light washed over arching glass towers, that seemingly stretched forever, climbing to farther and farther heights in a race to see who could touch the moon first. They are gleaming and shimmering down to the masses of colorful swirls of people below. The dull grey of the pavement is splashed with brilliant colors, as the populous dances across it, toting bags, and objects and foods and carts and other objects of whimsy, all painted in bright, eye popping hues. The sounds of laughter echo through the crowded streets, accented by honks and curses, all mixing together to create a symphony of sounds, that preform the song of the city for all to hear and join in to. Twittering birds flit around the landscape, hopping from tree to wire to ground to tree again, jumping in between feet and chairs, grabbing at forgotten morsels left behind. They add to the song, singing out notes and tones, and adding the beat of skippering steps and the feathered floosh of their wings flapping around. Lights flash in the streets, shifting the sound of the song of the city into a new direction, some cars now take the melody, revving their engines and skidding their tires, as other cars take a harmonious background tone as their engines lay in wait. The song never stops, only changes its tempo and pace, hardly pausing as voices join or silence, but instead simply singing and dancing in a beautiful cacophony. One day, perhaps the song will silence, but that day is not today, so instead the city rejoices, singing to the world that it is here and it is lively and beautiful and boisterous, and that it plans to stay, and that it plans to sing. It plans to sing for as long as it can.

 “ Dahrok! Dahrok get in here now! ” 
 
 “ -with significantly more numbers and power-''

 “ Quiet Gloopbar! Dahrok, you are my top strategist. For the love of Empress Poo Nah ’ Ni, explain to me why we are losing this war? These creatures on Planet 8XB1 are on the verge of annihilating our war machine! ” 
 
 “ Well sir, *gulp* it appears that our last invading-scouting report was 14 muullens ago. From the data we collected, the creatures were only capable of using basic tools from the planet. They fought in small scuffles with primitive tactics. We calculated the probability of their advancement when they would pose a threat to our invasion, and there was 0.05 % chance that they would be anywhere close to a match for us. ” 
 
 “ Yes I remember the frakking report! A 0.05 % chance my krak! Where was the mis-calculation?!? ” 
 
 “ Well sir, with their level of intelligence, we predicted that they would coalesce into a collective organism, like their biology dictates, and they would live in a relative-cooperative peace. Instead, they fought more. And more. And more… ” 
 
 “ Are you telling me these plebeians fought every umu for every frakking muullen?! ” 
 
 “ Yes sir. Over the last 14 muullens, these creatures continued to fight amongst themselves. And they excelled in all areas of military warfare.'' 
 
 “ And why weren ’ t we able to get any new reports over those 14 muullens?! Why weren ’ t we informed of their progress?!? ” 
 
 “ We were—err we did sir. Yyitssen reported the world ’ s advancements as of 1 muullen ago. After all, there was so much data to collect and process when we reach the planetary system that- “ 
 
 “ And what was his report!? ” 
 
 “ Sorry sir, he reported that creatures would pose a challenge, but there was only a 5 % chance that they would be comparable to us.'' 
 
 “ Well they certainly shattered that 5 %! Even if they fought for every umu for every muullen, how is this still possible?!? Our military has never been defeated!'' 
 
 “ Sir our latest probes have finished analyzing data from the last muullen. Apparently these creatures have not only developed the ability to weaponize the environment ’ s elemental configuration, but they train their youngest with fighting simulations CONSTANTLY. ” 
 
 “ Yes Foyt, we ’ ve all seen what their bombs do! And their laser ships! And their gas attacks! The entire 1st, 2nd, and 3rd regiments saw what they can do!! And what the frak do you mean by fighting simulations?! ” 
 
 “ Well sir, apparently they ’ re more war hungry than we deduced. Over the last rkoouk, millions upon billions of these creates have trained on simulators where they fight each other and AI simulations. We ’ ve watched the unprecedented bouts of violence from several phenomenon they call ‘ games': ‘ Halo ’ ‘ Destiny ’ ‘ Warcraft ’ ‘ Flagship ’ ‘ Xenocide ’ and many many more. They've spent more collective huuuen on these'games' than they're entire species existence. In fact, their entire society seems focused on fighting themselves and others, like us. They have these ‘ movies ’ and ‘ shows ’ that depicting and glorify fighting. They have active areas on the planet where these creatures fight each, and other creatures in non-combat areas do nothing to stop it. In fact, they facilitate it. ” 
 
 “ … ” 
 
 “ And the worst part is that they only get better. It seems that over the past 14 muullens, other alien creatures have crashed landed or been captured by these creatures. And planet 8XB1 ’ s creatures excel at deconstructing their enemy ’ s technology and using it for their own means. ” 
 
 “ Are you saying that they ’ ve had help with their technological-military advancement? ”

2391,"[ WP ] There are rituals that summon demons . Why are there no rituals that summon angels ?
","`` Vanishing,'' her hands cup the light, the fire dancing in her eyes. `` They are all vanishing.'' 
 
 She smiles at me, but too much effort can be seen in her face. She's tired. We all are. 
 
 Time passes as the moon moves through the clouds. Yuri sighs, curling his fingers through his beard. We both wait for Anna to continue, but she just stares into the fire, saying nothing. 
 
 I lean forward. `` Why are the angels dying?'' 
 
 Anna smiles again, her eyes meeting mine. Her pained look. Feigned ease masking despair. `` I do n't know.'' 
 
 Anna Sokolov is known as the Harbinger, the Merciful Rain, the Commandant of the Archangels. An officer in her own right, she is seen as less of a soldier and more as a superweapon. Within her flows the blood of a harken, a conjurer of angels. 
 
 I have seen the Harbinger repel an Asmodean ambush in a blaze of light and fire. I've seen her descend upon strongholds, the wings of her angels radiant against the evening sky. Seeing her take the field swelled my heart and filled me with hope. 
 
 The look on Anna's face somehow makes the wind colder. 
 
 `` I do n't know.'' She repeats, and her eyes trail away from mine. `` But they're leaving.'' Anna watches as the winter winds play with the fire. But they're leaving me. 
 
 Harkens have always spoke to angels. They do not know what it is like to sleep alone, to be without the presence. To them, angels are siblings, older brothers and sisters who have been with them since the beginning. 
 
 And now Anna is alone, with no one but the last of the regiment to keep her company. 
 
 Yuri shivers, takes another drink to numb himself against the cold. I study the lines on his face. A man in his late thirties with the footsoldier sigil on his arm. I have always avoided him; something about his stature, his silence, drew me in any direction but his. 
 
 Strange we are the only survivors. Strange that I survived all. 
 
 `` I heard news from the men in the valley,'' Yuri breaks the silence as he adds another log to the fire. `` They're stranded. Said their harken was killed. That his angles never came.'' 
 
 He brings his flasket to his lips and empties it, brushing the moisture from his lips. `` Without angels you have to pay with men. And against Asodeans, the price is very, very high.'' 
 
 `` So they wo n't be coming to get us?'' 
 
 Yuri frowns at me and I look away, worried that he can see the fear on my face. `` No,'' Yuri continues, `` They will not move to finish the maneuver. Ulus-kert remains devil territory.'' 
 
 I look at Anna. A pause, and then she reaches into her coat. Her hand comes out enclosed over something. She clasps it, her knuckles white. A second passes, and she lunges, the fire licking her fingers as she thrusts the object into the fire. I widen my eyes to catch a glimpse of what it was, but in an instant it is nothing more than the kindling beside it. 
 
 Anna leans back, her head resting on the cold ground below her. `` Kill the fire,'' She pulls her coat tight and turns on her side. `` We need to hide in the dark.''

","`` Are you sure I have to do this?'' Steve asked. He nervously thumbed the can of insecticide on his waist. At least they had provided him with that much - the can, and his old work uniform. He wished they had done more. 
 
 `` Afraid so, Steven.'' St. Peter said, laying a warm hand on his shoulder. `` It's the same for everyone, and everything. Heaven may be large, but it is not infinitely so. We're simply running out of space. For what it's worth, I'm sorry.'' 
 
 `` But... everything we've ever killed? Is that really necessary?'' Steven said. `` It seems a little... cruel, if you ask me. Even if they win, hundreds will have to die again.'' 
 
 To Steven's surprise, the angel chuckled. `` Only the ones with souls, Steven.'' He said. `` Just be glad that you are n't a hunter. Or that God, in his infinite wisdom, neglected to give bacteria access to paradise. Truly, *that* would be a match made in hell.'' 
 
 Steven swallowed, then nodded. `` Ok... I think I'm ready.'' He said. 
 
 
 `` Very well then, Steven.'' Said Peter. `` Close your eyes, and we can begin.'' 
 
 Steven closed his eyes. Almost immediately, however, the sound of cheering made him open them again. He was in an arena much like the Colosseum, complete with red-sand floor and stands filled to the brim with shining spirits. They seemed to blend together into a single mass of rainbow hue, so much so that he could n't tell where one ended and the next began. Sensing something was expected of him, he raised his hand, and the cheer redoubled in volume. Strangely, however, he seemed to be alone - not a trace of his competition seemed to be present. 
 
 `` Combatants! Are you ready?'' Cried a voice that echoed from all directions. 
 
 `` I... I am...'' Steven replied. Still, he saw no sign of his opponent. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw it: A singular cockroach, barely an inch long, standing not fifty feet in front of him. 
 
 `` Begin!'' Cried the voice. 
 
 The cockroach rushed him. It tore across the sand, baring down on him with what must have been incredible speed for the species - but it still took several seconds before it could close the gap between. By then, Steven was ready. With instincts born from years of honing his craft, he raised his boot, dropped it... and it was done. The beast was no more. 
 
 The crowd seemed to wince, growing silent for a moment before erupting into cheers even louder than before. 
 
 `` Excellent, Steven!'' Cried the announcer. `` You have beaten your first opponent! Would you like to take a rest, to reconvene on the morrow, or shall you have another?'' 
 
 `` Er, uh... I think I can take another?'' Steven said uncertainly. 
 
 `` He says another!'' Confirmed the announcer. `` Send in the next opponent!'' 
 
 The crowd went wild.

","Sasha felt the force of the knockback roll through her arm, the sudden impact knocking her hand back and the deafening crack of the gunshot, amplified a thousand times by the echoing walls of the subway tunnel, making her flinch. She stood disoriented for a moment, fully expecting a set of razor sharp teeth to tear out her throat at any moment. Only after several heartbeats, she allowed herself to open her eyes again. The creature's snout was only inches away from her face, its mouth a bloody mess, where the bullet had struck it, the silvery rows of teeth glittering even here in the perpetual darkness of the tunnels, illuminated only by one of the small plastic tubes, filled with a fluorescent solution, she carried with her. She backed away in shock, only after a moment realising, that the creature was dead, frozen in the unusual posthumous stasis that the creatures fell into when their hearts stopped beating. Assuming the creatures even had hearts. There was little, Sasha, or anyone she had met, knew about the creatures. Even killing them was a game of chance, you never knew, if a hit would actually do damage to the beasts or simply enrage them and the vulnerable points seemed to differ from creature to creature. 
 
 Sasha shook her head, stepping out of her own stasis. She had been in similar situations and had faced them with courage. She had gone into a whole building full of the armed men to rescue a small child, fought against a cult of murderous zealots and faced one of the creatures with only a knife, why was she now getting scared? What had broken her? The eyes of the creature still lingered on her. Their lifelessness was not a result of the creature's demise, she knew. There seemed to be nothing but death behind them, even when the creatures were still alive. If the eyes were windows to the soul, then what kind of god could have created a creature with a soul as twisted as what lingered behind these eyes? A man she had once loved had told her, that the creatures had no souls because they were unholy. Godless. Sasha felt godless herself right now. She wondered if the same spark of death was in her eyes as well. She shook her head again. There was no time for theology now. The gunshot would have drawn the attention of more creatures. She had to move, get to safety. She picked up her light, decided on a direction and headed down the dark tunnel. 
 
 She had n't walked for more than a minute when she noticed her light growing dim. Sasha frowned. The tubes were meant to last for just over two hours and she had picked this one not more than twenty minutes ago. It should have about an hour left before starting to go dim. She must have picked a faulty one, she thought, hurrying down the increasingly darkening corridor a bit faster, but the light of the tube seemed to vanish exceedingly fast now. After another minute or so, it was almost completely dark, the walls of the tunnel almost completely out of sight. Silently cursing, she checked her backpack for a new tube, setting the faulty one on the floor next to her. There were only three more tubes left. She cursed again, picking one and cracking the small seal, that released the chemicals, that mixed to form the solution. The new tube remained completely dark, not even emitting as much light as the one she had discarded on the floor next to her. She looked around. she could n't see the walls at all now and even her own hands were starting to vanish in the darkness, that was slowly creeping up on her. Two faulty tubes at once, that was just her luck. She picked up the second tube, cracking the seal, just as the last light of the first tube vanished and paused. Nothing happened. The tunnels remained dark. Sasha felt her heartbeat increase. She felt for her backpack, sticking her hand in the pocket that held the tubes and... nothing. The tube was gone. Frantically she searched the backpack, throwing out its contents on the cold floor. The creatures could hunt in the dark, if one of them caught her without a light, she would have no way of defending herself. She used both hands now to shovel the contents out of the pack now, panic rising in her throat. She grabbed the pack, turned it around and emptied it's contents on the floor, feeling for the small tube. If she did n't find it, she would never get out of here. Lost in the Subway tunnels until one of the beasts found her or she starved. Where was the damn light? She *had* to find it! Just as she was about to give up, her fingers closed around something long and cylindrical. The tube! Triumphantly she held it up, cracking the seal and... nothing. The Tunnel remained completely dark. Sasha started to cry. 
 
 Sasha lay on the floor, tears running down her face. How long had she spent like that? Minutes? Hours? Days? She could n't remember. She was hungry, but she could n't find the food she had brought between her belongings scattered on the floor. She was gong to die. She had always known that. First, as an abstract thought, something that happened in the future, later as something that could happen every time, a threat, that was always right around the corner. But there had always been a chance of survival. A way out. She could fight, she could run, she could live. This time there was no way out. She was going to die and there was nothing she could do about it. Die, like Klava, who lay rotting in some tunnel south of here. Like Demyan and Egor, dead after an attack on their old base. Their corpses unburied. Like Diana, tortured and raped by a man they had called holy. And the others would follow. Masha, Lyosha, Yesfir, they'd all be dead. And Felix too. Felix, whom she had searched for almost a year now. Whom she would now never see again in this live. Would she see him again, in another live? The light at the end of the tunnel grew dim. Just a few hours ago ( or had it been days already? ) she had proclaimed herself godless. How could a godless one ever enter the afterlife? No, she would not see Felix again, her whole quest had been a failure. She would not go to some heaven, where she would see them all again, she would even be denied hell. She would simply fade away. Go to sleep and never wake up. Vanish, like the light. They all would. None could escape the darkness, so what did it matter. Why bother? Why cling to life, to that tiny bit of light in the middle of the dark? It was going to vanish anyway. She watched the light defiantly float in the distance, pulsing, refusing to vanish. 
 
 She stopped. The light? Where was the light coming from? How had she not noticed it before? She scrambled to her feet, looking at the light in the distance. It was slowly vanishing, but there was definitely a faint light coming from in front of her. She stumbled forwards, breaking into a jog, then a sprint, unwilling to let go of the light. She could make out a shape now. The light was rectangular, with a rounded top. Like a doorway she realised, running faster. The doorway started to glow stronger and stronger until it seemed like it was made of light. She stopped right in front of it. The light from the door was blinding, in the eternal darkness. She paused. Was this heaven? Was she dead? How could this be heaven, if she was godless? She shook her head. She could n't go back to the darkness now, so she took a deep breath and stepped forward into the blinding light. 
 
 She found herself on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the ocean. A red sunrise illuminated the cliff face, its reflection wavering in the obsidian water, and down below she could make out black waves, slowly chipping away at the silvery grey rocks. Behind her, the green plains sloped downwards, ending in a mixed forest with no sign of the door of light. To her left, a man in a white robe sat on the cliff, feet dangling down, eyes fixed on the sunrise. His skin was smooth and his short brown hair only beginning to grey but there was a feeling of age to him, like no man she had ever seen. He smiled amicably, eyes still fixed on the rising sun and spoke. 
 
 `` You can call me Pavel'', his soft voice barely audible over the crashing of the waves down below. 
 
 `` What? ``, Sasha stuttered. 
 
 `` We have met before, but you will not remember'' 
 
 `` What is this place?'' 
 
 `` The edge of the world.'' 
 
 Sasha fell silent. She did not understand. The man did n't look like God. 
 
 `` You ask yourself, why you are here. ``, Pavel said. 
 
 `` Why *am* I here? ``, Sasha replied, feeling lost. 
 
 `` An age-old question. ``, Pavel replied, `` You are here because I want you too.'' 
 
 `` So you will not answer me? ``, Sasha said, suddenly annoyed. 
 
 `` No, but you will answer. ``, was his reply. 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` I have been sitting, waiting on the edge of the world, waiting for you to tell the truth to me.'' 
 
 Sasha stopped. The truth? What did the man want? She had no idea, what was happening. It seemed to her, she never knew the truth of anything. All she knew was that... 
 
 `` I do n't want to die. ``, she said. The man smiled again. 
 
 `` You need n't. Look behind you.'' 
 
 She turned, looking at the forest. The light was growing stronger and she could make out a deer, looking at her at the edge of the forest. 
 
 `` I do n't...'', she began, turning around, but the man was gone. She stared at the place, where he had been sitting, for a moment, then she closed her mouth and turned around. The deer still stood at the edge of the forest, regarding her. She began walking towards it.

1259,"[ WP ] You have discovered an old typewriter in your attic , but it does more than simply print words onto paper ...
","As far back as I can recall, I ’ ve written worlds. That ’ s not a figure of speech, either. The words flow from my pen to the paper, and in that transition entire elsewheres are born. Even my first childhood attempts at world-building contained depth within the hastily scrawled lettering. I ’ ve spent the last twenty years refining the delicate craft; twelve volumes decorate my shelves now, leather-bound worlds, unique in every way. 
 
 That ’ s the part that ’ s always bothered me: the books ’ uniqueness makes them almost impossible to share. I tried with my sons, but even fully grown men got greedy when handed the tools of creation. And if my own flesh and blood disappointed me so thoroughly, how can I hope to let the world relish in my works? 
 
 It was a stroke of luck, stumbling upon that typewriter; years would have melted away before the thought to venture into that section of the attic would have crossed my mind again. The dusty contraption sat atop the sealed boxes of my sons ’ childhood memories. In my haste, I stubbed my toe on an awkwardly protruding cabinet. The words that flew from my fiery tongue weren ’ t memorable; their perfect transcription by the ancient typewriter left a far more lasting impression. 
 
 Suddenly, my worlds could be shared. That moment changed everything. 
 
 I ’ ve never regretted any decision more in my life. The mass-produced elsewheres exist, sure, but all the emotion – every bit that made my leather-bound volumes come alive – is gone. The paperback pages have been bled dry of feeling. No one wants a book full of words without an ounce of depth between them. 
 
 My delicate craft lies in ruin. 
 
 I lay down my pen. 
 
 The last of the world-builders is finished.

10156,"[ WP ] Write a story that makes the following phrase true : `` The best offense is a good defense '' .
","The raids were a part of our lives for as far back as our history goes. Every winter, the nomads would swoop in and steal our food and resources. We had to work extra hard to ensure everyone in our tribe had enough to eat but this year we did n't have enough for everyone, much less the nomads. They depended on us for survival. They did n't have the means to, or did n't have the want to, raise livestock or grow crops. They moved around stealing from different tribes throughout the year and we just happened to be their pick for winter. 
 
 But they had a surprise waiting for them. This year, we devoted most of our efforts to improving the city walls. The walls were measly 10 foot high logs surrounding our village. Now, they're solid stone stretching more than 50 feet into the air. Topped with iron spikes and watch towers filled with archers. A monstrous wooden door that took a dedicated team of a dozen men to open. We became a fortress overnight. Because of all these preparations, we had to divert manpower from tending crops and livestock. Our food supply was low. If the nomads were able to breach our defenses, we would not survive. But if we could hold strong, they would be the ones to starve. One of us would not make it through the winter.
