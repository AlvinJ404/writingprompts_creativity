","**Ice Cream** 
 
 
 Bleary-eyed and half asleep Johnny wiped the sleeve of his pajamas over his eyes to see his dad standing over him, shaking his shoulder. Streaks of red wet the front of his dads dress shirt. 
 A sour smell filled the air along with the heavy scent of metal. In the faint light filtering in through the curtains Johnny saw the handgun his dad kept in his office lockbox, tucked securely behind his belt. 
 
 “ Daddy what ’ s going on? ” 
 
 “ We ’ re going for a ride, get up. ” Johnny thought his dads wide smile looked like the crazed grin a villain from a comic would flash the hero. Even at the age of eight it made him uneasy. 
 
 His dad reached out a hand as Johnny spoke back, “ Where ’ s mommy? Is she going on the ride with us? ” He got out from under the covers and followed his dad into the hall. 
 
 Speaking in a low whisper he said “ No, she ’ s sleeping, be careful not to wake her. She ’ d be mad if she knew I was taking you for ice cream this late. ” That same wide smile spread over his face. 
 
 Johnny looked up to his dad as they walked, “ Daddy, Mom said you were away on business and that you wouldn ’ t be back for a while. She told me to go to sleep and to not wait for you. ” 
 
 “ Oh I ’ m sure she did say that, because that ’ s what she thought. But your dad ’ s back, for a surprise visit. And she already got her surprise, now it ’ s time for yours. ” 
 
 Johnny was beaming, “ Ice cream? ” 
 
 “ Ice cream. ” 
 
 Even with the thought of ice cream and the comforting feel of his dads hand wrapped over his own the uneasy feeling hadn ’ t left him. He had an urge to follow his nose, to peer into the darkness of his parents ’ bedroom where the scent of smoke and blood was the strongest. So he did. As they walked past the bedroom Johnny strained to look into the inky black, the acrid smell stinging his nostrils. He saw shapes, a figure slumped over in his parent ’ s bed. By the door, illuminated by a sliver of light from the hallway Johnny saw the blood streaked hand of another man. His grip on his dad tightened as they hurried for the stairs. 
 
 Once outside Johnny saw the neighbors lights were on in Mrs. Grant ’ s house, and she was standing in the window on the phone. She was pointing wildly at his dad. All down the street houselights came on. Families woken by the sound of muffled gunfire and harsh screams. 
 
 Johnny ’ s dad opened the car door and had him sit in the back, strapping him in. 
 
 As his dad got behind the wheel Johnny spoke again, “ Mommy isn ’ t sleeping is she? ” For a boy of eight his voice was low and grave. 
 
 Looking over his shoulder at Johnny his dad returned a stern look. “ No. ” 
 
 “ Dad, why can ’ t Mom come with us? ” 
 
 His dad put the key into the ignition and turned. As the engine roared to life he placed the gun in the glove compartment and muttered under his breath, “ Because Mommy doesn ’ t love Daddy anymore. ”

","*President Clark's Approval Ratings Soar to New Highs after SotU Speech* 
 
 The headline of the newspaper waiting for Derek Clark on his desk seemed almost to mock him. Here he was, still in the Oval Office, as another one of his impeachment plans seemed to have spectacularly backfired. 
 
 He rubbed his still throbbing temples, and paged his Secretary, 
 
 `` Jane, can you bring me some Alka-Seltzer please? Oh... and have someone bring me a Volcano Vaporizer and the dankest weed you can find.'' 
 
 `` Certainly, Mr. President. Will you be addressing the media today?'' 
 
 `` I'm not sure yet. Thank you.'' 
 
 Derek sighed and turned on the TV. *Might as well find out what the media is praising me for now* he thought... struggling to remember what had happened during the State of the Union Address the day before. 
 
 An attractive woman sat at the news desk, looking tired but excited `` Around the world, political leaders are calling for the decriminalization of all drugs, mass disarmament, and a complete overhaul of prison systems. All this in the wake of President Clark's inspiring speech. We hit the streets to interview regular citizens to get their reactions. Tom Stevens has the report.'' 
 
 `` Thanks Michelle. By now you should know the story - the President delivered a stunning State of the Union Speech -- all while under the influence of LSD, Marijuana, Psilocybin Mushrooms, and I quote'a few bumps of some bomb-ass coke' 
 
 In what might turn out to be the highest rated broadcast in the entire world, President Clark delivered a two-hour long free form speech that has inspired millions. We asked for your reactions, and here's what some of you had to say'' 
 
 The camera cut to an old white man, `` When President Clark took that blunt out, and started talking about how we live in societal prisons to the system, it was like something just clicked for me.'' 
 
 Another cut to a young black woman, `` I was most touched by how he talked about peace, and how when you're tripping balls all the colors of the world just melt away'' 
 
 A young Hispanic male, `` When he got in the face of several senators and just kept singing that'Fuck the Po-lice. Stand for justice.' song he made up... it was beautiful, man. Just beautiful.'' 
 
 Derek turned the TV off in disgust and threw the remote out the window. `` HOW IN THE HELL AM I GOING TO GET IMPEACHED!?!?!?'' he screamed. 
 
 He hated the job, and had wanted out almost immediately after he was sworn in. None of it had worked. He'd slapped senators on national TV who turned out to be corrupt, promptly resigning from shame. He'd made up government holidays dedicated to unicorns and group sex and was declared a `` forward thinking patriot.'' He'd fired every decorated military general and ordered all american warships to be sunk and was declared a `` Guardian of peace.'' He'd shouted racial epithets during cabinet meetings and was worshiped for `` making stereotypes and racism meaningless'' 
 
 All of this was frustrating... but doing drugs before and during the State of the Union Address? Making sure everyone KNEW how high he was and giving a speech he himself could barely remember? What could he do? 
 
 He sat in the most powerful chair in the world, fuming. His Secretary brought him his alka-seltzer and vaporizer with `` OG Kush'' to put in it. As he drew in a long breath, he got another idea that he thought might finally work...

","Hank coughed through the smoke, `` Jesus... hell its a damn dustbowl,'' Hank said as he waved his hand about. A few embers floated around him. Wind hurled past, pushing the dust down the corn fields. 
 
 `` Yeah, do n't use that name or I just,'' the Devil lit a cigarette as a pause, `` shit all over your soul for at least a decade. Like actual shit, and believe me, it is not one of those polite regular American diet shits- no straight curry down in H-town. Anyway, what's up... Hank, right?'' The devil stood in the pentagram of corn leaves Hank had left out. 
 
 `` That's me... anyway, what's this fucking book say,'' Hank thumbed through a book piled under dust. `` Satan, master of the underworld, I've come to offer you a gift of my virgin soul for only a mortal's request!'' Hank opened his eyes, he'd just experienced true power in his voice; his vocal chords shook like an E string of a bass guitar ushering in a new song. 
 
 `` Yeah, I've got enough of those. I've already got millions. What else have you got? I mean the virgin souls these days spew through the rocks in my floor, seriously this generation needs to stop killing children or start getting laid like the did in the 15th century,'' Satan flicked his cigarette into a cornfield just behind him. The ember quickly caught a dry husk incinerating stalk after stalk in just seconds. 
 
 `` Um... the book does n't say much about anything else to offer. I've got some organs or, like my truck.'' 
 
 `` Dude that beat up'97 Chevy. No I hear songs about that shit all day, hicks always go to hell, I want your... oh I could really upsell that kidney. Yeah, give me the left one- the right's got some weird tube worm in it,'' Satan circled the right kidney with his sword sharp finger. Hank did n't know pain could get so intolerable so fast, especially when you watch your own kidney float out of your body as blood warms your clothes. `` These pentagrams ai n't shit with technology. I learned how to get my way past this five-pointed dunce hat millennia ago. Regardless you've got your woman's heart or whatever.'' 
 
 `` Marissa will love me then?'' 
 
 `` Well, if she was n't suddenly dead. Here's her heart though- fun fact- she gave this up to be with that farm hand Todd who works for you. He's hauling a ten-inch snake she was always dreaming of. Peace!'' The devil threw up the peace sign and vanished in a puff of smoke. Marissa's heart sat between the leaves that formed the pentagram just beating slower and slower. 
 
 `` Thanks for showing me how to play Satan, I'll be back,'' Hank shoved a rag from his back pocket into the kidney sized wound in his chest. He had perhaps ten minutes to seal the wound before he passed out and dies, from blood loss. That beat up old Chevy could make it to the farm in time no doubt about it. Now Hank just had to line up the dominoes of souls for Satan and he'd get what he actually desired, a booming country music career.

","Re: Fwd: WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK YOU FUCKERS!?!?!?!?! 
 
 Dear Mr. Johnson, 
 
 I received the news of your Olympic Silver Medal with great dismay, and I must extend my sincerest apologies for the poor quality of service you have received from our organization. I assure you that I pride myself on the quality of our customer service, and personally take full responsibility for the error that has resulted in this state of affairs. 
 
 In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that not only did our organization fail to live up to the standards we were committed to delivering, but, due to a clerical error, we were regrettably also involved in the enhancement of the performance of your opponent Herr Hoffman. 
 
 The issue was one of semantics: Your request to excel as the `` greatest shot putter in the history of track and field,'' was, due to our internal quantification of `` greatness,'' filed under `` Track and field,'' while Herr Hoffman's request to be the `` Best shot putter in the world,'' was filed under `` Shot put.'' We do have quality assurance professionals on staff to try and control for just this sort of slip up, but as they say, nobody's perfect, an aphorism that is rather especially true of the kinds of people who qualify for employment with me. 
 
 I tell you all this, Mr. Johnson, not because I'm trying to offer any excuse, but because I feel you deserve to know. I also want you to know just how much your personal spirit of persistence and ambition inspires me personally, and how grieved I am that I have been unable to deliver what I promised you. 
 
 As far as our next possible steps, I can see two possible courses of action moving forward. I can certainly offer you a full refund, and I am open to negotiating a penalty fee payable by our organization for not delivering on our previous contract. Given that there was no such fee negotiated in the previous contract, such a penalty would need to be established upon further negotiation with our lawyers, but popular requests that we have granted in the past have been along the lines of personal islands filled with servile and nubile natives, sufficient personal funds to live in luxury for the rest of your life, and the ever-popular enhancements to sexual prowess and desirability. 
 
 Alternately, if you still wish to pursue the terms of your original contract and, as you put it, thoroughly `` Fuck that smug motherfucker with his gold fucking medal and stupid fucking grin,'' I have taken the liberty of drawing up an addendum to your original contract ( please see attached ), which details an alternate plan to reinstate you as the greatest shot putter in the world. 
 
 In conclusion, I will apologize again for the grief and frustration you have experienced because of our organization, and ask that you give us a final chance to make you whole. If you wish to proceed with the refund, please let me know via reply message, and I will put you in touch with the head of our contracts department to negotiate an amenable contract termination. If you wish to pursue the course of action I have laid out to remedy the original breach of contract, simply click the box below indicating you have read an accept the terms of the contract addendum. 
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 S. B. Lucifer, Esq. 
 
 Hell Inc., Co-Founder and CEO 
 
 
 [ ] I have read and understand the attached contractual addendum, and agree to abide by its terms.

","I stood atop the gilded parapets of my holy Choir Hall, surrounded by carved sigils of meter and tempo. Marble statues of my patron deities, a pantheon of Gods and Goddesses whose divine Voices I had brought to the masses of this world, stood at my side. 
 
 Gazing down upon the brutish hordes at my gate, slobbering orcs hungry for the hoard of gold and jewels I guarded within. Some of it tithings from my believers, some of it conjured by Divine Voice. They craved the wealth of my faith for themselves. But I am the guardian of the Voices. I alone wield the mighty iPod, whose power knows no limits in this place. I sifted through it's catalog of spells, the will of the Voices. Lifting the iPod high, I gave ultimatum to the hoard at my doors. `` I am the Will of the Voices, and this shall be the only warning I deliver. LEAVE this holy place, or die by Their will!'' 
 
 The horde of orcs roared a mighty roar, their mighty voices uniting into a wave of force that bashed against my Choir Hall. But it held firm, as I knew it would. Voice and sound hold power in this place, but simple brutish shouting would never match the power of structured refined song. A lesson I would now teach them. I pointed the iPod at a nearby hillside, and with a silent prayer to Saint Miley I invoked my first spell: 
 
 # *I came in like a wrecking ball! * 
 
 The hillside exploded, a rush of rock and earth burying the brutish horde alive. They ran from the onslaught, shouting their warcries to push back at the landslide with raw force. I knew what my next spell must be. An invocation to Beyoncé, and... 
 
 # *If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it! * 
 
 A glittering band of gold rose from the ground, trapping the orcs inside. It shrank, forcing the horde into a cluster of writhing angry bodies. The bashed at it with their fists and their voices, bent and broke it and freed themselves. Damn, that's right, natural gold is very soft. Note to self, invoking a spell about a GOLD ring is not practical for combat scenarios. 
 
 Perhaps something more practical, then. A horde for a horde. A prayer to the Weather Girls, and... 
 
 # *It's raining men! Hallelujah, it's raining men! * 
 
 From the skies fell an army of armed and armored constructs, mindless golems forged of sky-ice who serve only the Voices. They landed at the orc's rear flank, and a full battle broke out. I decided to strike at the orcish horde with a mighty sundering, to shatter their ranks and bring swift victory to the Voices. By the will of Lady Taylor: 
 
 # *I'm just gon na shake, shake shake shake shake. Shake it off, shake it off. * 
 
 A mighty earthquake shook the ground beneath the orcs, collapsing their ranks as the ice golems swarmed the horde. Routed, they fled from the Choir Hall, their battle cries growing weaker as their numbers thinned. 
 
 They would be back, and with a greater chorus, to try and assault my walls again. But as long as the Divine Voices stood by my side, we would never fall.

","My cell phone vibrated my alarm. I blearily hit snooze and turned over. I snuggled deeper into my blankets and drifted to unconsciousness once more. 
 
 -- - 
 
 Again the alarm. Had it been five minutes already? I cracked open an eye and checked the time on my phone. Noon. Had I really slept in that late? I closed my eyes again, hands balling up into fists. `` I ca n't believe you're so lazy.'' I chastised myself. `` Ca n't even get out of bed like a normal, productive member of society''. I opened my eyes and glared at the ceiling as if I'd find something there worthy of enough hate that I'd get out of bed to punch it. Alas, my mind found nothing but myself. I shut my eyes, too tired to even attempt to refute my own laziness and drifted back into unconsciousness as some part of me screamed and yelled about how I was lazy and unmotivated and that I'd never amount to anything. 
 
 -- - 
 
 The alarm again. How annoying. I squinted at the bright screen. 1:30, the display mockingly read. I gritted my teeth, steeled my body, and gave myself a pep talk. `` You've already opened your eyes. You're wide awake. All you have to do is sit up. Even babies can do that. Surely it should be a simple task for a grown human. Ready? 3... 2... 1... Up''. I tried. I really did. My mind screamed its command and I tried with every receptive fiber of my being. Too bad they were vastly outnumbered by the unreceptive ones. My body taunted me by flexing enough muscles to get my head off the pillow. I slumped back, drained. `` One more time.'' I told myself. `` You can do this.'' 
 
 I headfaked myself by pushing myself up with my arms before another long-winded prep-talk could form. I sat, pushing my back against the wall and pulling my knees to my chin. I hugged my legs. `` Good job, you. Let's see what life has in store for us today.'' From my sitting position, I stretched for my glasses on the bedside table, careful not to fall back into the treacherous covers. I took in my surroundings. 
 
 The small room was stark. Barren with the exception of my bed, a door on the opposite wall, and a table in the middle of the room. On the table sat a bottle of water and a pill bottle. Curious, I pushed myself out of bed to take a closer look. The pill bottle was unlabeled, as was the water bottle. Both were full. I opened the bottle and sniffed. I dabbed a finger in it and licked my finger. Definitely water. Curious. I walked to the door. There were no windows on it, nor a peephole. I grasped the doorknob and opened the door. 
 
 I stood before a long hallway. It stretched before me, seemingly endless. Doors dotted the sides periodically. I walked to the first one on my left and opened it. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I stepped onto a bridge. It was a sunny day. The bridge was long, and oddly deserted. I walked along its length, listening to the wind and the waves below. I looked over the edge. Far below. I shuddered and hurried across the remaining length. There was a door at the other end. I opened it and found myself back in the hallway. 
 
 I walked to the right and opened the door at the end to orient myself. This was my bedroom again. I had exited out of the same door despite crossing the span of the bridge. There were the bottles of water and pills, staring back at me innocently. I closed the door and retreated back into the hallway. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I tried the door on the right this time. I found myself at a subway station. An announcement foretold an approaching train. I watched, transfixed, as the light at the end of the tunnel grew larger and brighter. And then it was gone. The train whizzed passed. Not stopping here today. A few abandoned newspapers rustled in a small tornado in the corner. A screen wearily displayed that there would be another train in five minutes. I did n't stay for the second one, opting to return to the hallway. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I tried the next door down and found myself in my kitchen. It was n't *my* kitchen though. It was perfectly clean. Every surface glared at me with a sterilized glitter. Something glinted in my peripheral. I had a gut feeling I knew what it was, but found myself unable to face it. I threw open the fridge. Empty. The cupboards. Empty too. Every single drawer under the counter. All empty. I even opened the oven and the little drawer underneath it that I never knew the name of. Empty. After I exhausted every possible procrastination option, I finally turned to face the source of the glint. The Knife sat on the center of the island, lit by an overhead lamp. It was the knife that did all the heavy lifting in the kitchen. Sharp enough to slice fish for sushi. Strong enough to cleave through bone. I hated The Knife. It symbolized everything that wrong with my life. With me. I gritted my teeth. `` Too weak to live, too cowardly to die.'' The Knife snickered at me. `` Shut up'' I said out loud. I stepped forward and slid my fingers around its handle. The warm handshake of an old friend. 
 
 -- - 
 
 *'' So you're telling me that all I have to do for a second chance at life, is die?'' I examined the Devil's face. He was n't what all the stories in the mortal realm had lead me to believe. He was a clean-cut man. Suit. Swept back hair. Impeccable teeth. Manicured nails. * 
 
 *'' Yes. Starting three hours from now. You'll know when.'' He snapped his fingers. I drifted into unconsciousness. * 
 
 -- - 
 
 My mind returned to the situation at hand. And The Knife in hand. I knew what I had to do. I do n't know how long I stood there. Alone in my kitchen that was n't my own. I did n't know how much time I'd spent playing out this exact scene when I was alive either. But that was hardly relevant anymore. I slowly rolled up my left sleeve to the elbow, taking care to smooth out any wrinkles that formed. I picked The Knife back up, rolling my grip around it ever tighter as if I was trying to choke the life out of it. `` This is going to be easier than it ever was in the previous life.'' I told myself. I know what's waiting for me at the other end this time. Life. I held the knife to my left wrist. I felt its sharpness. Its thirst. I again paused and stood unmoving as time bled by, staring at the point where metal met flesh. One cut. That's all that was needed. I'd be alive again. `` You can do this. 3... 2... 1... CUT''. My mind screamed. My muscles tightened. The Knife sat unmoving, glinting in the light and mocking my ability to carry out my own will. It's cold blade slowly sapped the warmth from my body. I put The Knife down, ears ringing with its taunting laughter, turned my back, hung my head, and shuffled out the door. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I returned to the other rooms. I recognized them now. I sat on the edge of my bridge that was n't mine with my legs dangling over the side, just like I used to with my bridge. I'd watch the clouds billow by and tell myself I'd slide myself forward each time one cast a shadow over me. I never did. I do n't know how long I sat there. 
 
 -- - 
 
 My subway station that was n't mine was no different. I stood, leaning against a pillar and watched as train after train sped by, counting down the minutes with the announcer until the train sped by. Every once in a while, as the time drew nearer, I pushed myself off of my pillar, but never far enough to fall over the tracks. A few times I walked out onto the track and stood there for several minutes, peering down the dark tunnel and pondering where the train came from and where it would take me. Each time I would return to my post before the light reappeared. I do n't know how long I stood there. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I returned to my room that was n't my room, unsure how much time I'd spent staring into the face of life. I barely spared a glance at the bottles on the table, and slunk into bed. I pulled the covers around me. Over my head. I buried myself in their warm and softness. I was tired. Exhausted. Drained of energy from trying so hard and failing just as hard. I sighed. `` How did my Hell on Earth become my Hell in Hell?'' I thought to myself. I was so tired. `` Perhaps I'll try again tomorrow.'' I whispered as I slowly drifted off to sleep. `` Yes. Tomorrow...''

 * < You have tasssted my power > * hissed the eldritch voice again. The paladin knew that in his battle fervor he had made a terrible mistake sullying hands upon the sword. Its blade was the color of soot, the pommel was a black stone carved into the shape of an open eye with a great ruby where the pupil should be, the two handed grip was bound with a pale leather tattooed with runes. Human skin he realized, accepting his fate. He had fed the swords evil by taking a life with it and now black corruption was growing within him. He grasped the sword by its bare blade just below the hilt and tugged. It pulled free without resistance. Swiftly kneeling he plunged the point into the blood soaked mud of the inner courtyard. 
 * < Ussse me again > * it whispered now louder. * < I hunger > * 
 He began to pray. 
 * < I thirssst > * 
 Arcane words not heard in centuries wreathed the bruised and sweaty face of the paladin in ghostly light as he ignored the lich voice and continued his muttered prayer. 
 * < I sshall help you ssserve > * the voice was booming now. 
 The Paladin could feel his will dissolving, the chill of the grave began creeping along his arms, swirls of frost forming upon the golden plates covering his arms. The eye upon the pommel rolled to stare at him as the sword howled. 
 * < Sssheathe me in flesh and you sshall have allll the power of the night > * 
 His hands clenched tighter and the ebony blade began to drink anew. 
 * < We are bonded in blood and fate > * 
 The paladin finished his holy incantation. He stood, now aglow with holy fire, and addressed the blade, the piled corpses, himself, and his gods. 
 `` I SHALL NEVER FALTER FROM THE RIGHTIOUS PATH.'' Boomed his massive voice, and he plunged the blade into his own torso. The blade passed through his thick armor effortlessly, drawn to the life within. 
 
 The villagers outside the burning monastery clutched their spears and huddled closer to the bonfires ringing the monastery gate as they waited to see if their savior had prevailed. The massive warrior priest had arrived not long after the dead had begun to rise. He had been resplendent in his heavy plate armor, holy light had seemed to radiate from him and his great white mace. Long into the moonless night they waited as the stones cracked within the blazing monastery until shortly before dawn the entire structure collapsed. The villagers began to trickle away in groups. None dared to search among the smoldering rubble for the man who had ended the pestilence. 
 
 It was good that they hadn ’ t for as the last and bravest of the villagers turned to leave he thought he could hear a faint voice somewhere behind him whispering. 
 * < Pick me up > * 
 * < I THIRSSST > *

","Milo Thatch. Such a strange name; such a strange creature to stumble upon her traps like an insect in a web. He and his entire convoy had wandered into the Atlantean ruins as if it were nothing; the thought was utterly inconceivable. Nonetheless, their arrival was a sign from the Gods, the Prophecy was to be fulfilled. The Gods had damned her city for its beauty, yet it harbored such hatred and terror beneath its serene façade. Soon the Gods would see just how vicious her people could truly be. 
 
 Leading them to the city was child ’ s play, they never questioned her motives or authority, simply followed like lambs to the slaughter. It all went as foretold; the city welcomed the newcomers with open arms, bestowed them with gifts and ensured they were greeted with every comfort and pleasure the city could provide. They were blissfully unaware of the carnage that awaited them as they slumbered, heavily sedated from the feast they were gifted that evening. 
 
 The glow of the blue crystal around Kida ’ s neck had long since faded, yet she could still feel the soft ebb of its power; its lust for blood and flesh. She and her people prepared for the ritual, swarming like ants to a carcass through the night. Everything must go to plan, we must do this right in order to permit our return to the surface. As the orange hue of the new day began to cast itself over the city, they began. 
 
 Milo Thatch was the first to be collected, his emaciated frame proving most easy to move even as he continued to slumber. One by one, the convoy members were collected, bound and painted; their bodies sanctified as gifts to the Gods. As the sun began to rise, Kida stepped forward, her body adorned in ornate robes, a magnificent headdress atop her head. Within her palm, she held a crystal dagger that seemed to almost hum with anticipation. 
 
 It was then that Milo began to awaken, his eyes still leaden from the remnants of the potent herbs that flowed through his veins. The bright morning light shone harshly on his face, his eyes narrowing as he tried to see through the glare. Standing before him was a goddess of a woman; her silhouette outlined in a golden aura as she slowly walked towards him. 
 
 `` Kida?'' 
 
 He was hesitant; she had not spoken a word, yet her body continued to move rhythmically towards him. It was then that he saw it; that malicious blade that rested within her delicate palm, it ’ s crystalline surface gleaming ominously in the morning light. He shuffled back, only to be met with cold, hard granite against his back. A feverish sweat began to bead upon his forehead as he stammered, the fear thick in his throat. 
 
 `` Kida..? Kida, what are you doing? Kida! Kida, speak to me!'' 
 
 His desperate cries did not sway Kida, they coaxed her. They convinced her that he was nothing more than a pathetic animal, shivering in fear when he should be at the pinnacle of pride. Did he not know what glory would befall him? That he would take a place amongst the Gods? Pathetic. Standing but a few feet from him, she lifted her hand, placing it atop his head. He shook viciously, tears streaming down his face as two men came to restrain him. As he was held down, Kida held her blade up towards the luminous crystal that hung in their sky and chanted, her voice monotonous and resolute. 
 
 `` I give your blood and flesh to the Gods as penance for my city; may they look down upon our offering with joy and grant us forgiveness.'' 
 
 The entire circle began to repeat the phrase, chanting and growing in anticipation and enthusiasm as she placed her palm upon the blade. Drawing back sharply she sliced through her skin, a thick line of crimson pooling up into her hand as she smeared it across the blade. Milo whimpered and sobbed as the men stretched him out, his gut exposed and vulnerable. Without hesitation, Kida brought down the blade, piercing Milo ’ s gut and dragging it across the length of his abdomen. A blood curdling scream echoed through the granite pillars as his entrails spilled out onto the stone. The remains of the convoy all lay waiting in terror, their incomprehensible screams and cries merely goading the circle of onlookers to chant louder, their feet stamping the ground beneath them rhythmically. 
 
 Kida plunged her hands into Milo ’ s gut, pulling the entrails out and holding them skyward as she began to chant once more. The warm blood dripped down her arms and onto her face, a malevolent smile stretching across her features. 
 
 `` I give your blood and flesh to the Gods as penance for my city; may they look down upon our offering with joy and grant us forgiveness!'' 
 
 The crowd fell silent as she rose to her feet, the organs still pulsing weakly in her palms. She wrenched them from Milo ’ s body, a splatter of blood painting the onlookers a stark crimson red. Milo Thatch was no more; his eyes had lulled back and his heaving breath had finally ceased. The two men collected his body and move it away, preparing his flesh for the feast that would come soon after. Turning to the convoy, she examined each tearful face, her voice cold and emotionless. 
 
 `` I will take Audrey Ramirez next, bring her to me.''

165303,"[ WP ] A long held family heirloom turns out to be the egg of a dragon that finally hatches a few days after you inherit it .
","Holding it for the first time, I recalled all the times I had stared at the jade egg, dusted around it, even polished it when I was old enough, making sure to leave it exactly in its place. I had never seen it anywhere but on my grandmother ’ s mantle in my 26 years of life thus far. Gran was nearing the end though, and said it needed a new keeper. 
 
 “ That jade egg has been in the family for generations, ” she told me. “ You must protect it. When you move it, make sure to keep the egg in its stand, and avoid any sudden motion. It must be given a place of honor in your house. You are the keeper now. ” 
 
 There was an old family story that the jade egg had been a gift from an ancient Chinese emperor. Nobody could remember which emperor or dynasty, but it didn ’ t matter to us. The egg ’ s real value was in that whoever owned it got first go at food at reunions. There was some other tradition that dictated why that was too, but it was as forgotten as the emperor. All we remembered was that the owner got food first. Nobody would have argued with letting Gran get food first, but now I ’ d be the one with first go at the food. It was an honor that Gran had picked me out of her 3 living children and 11 grandchildren, but I suppose that since she had raised me, it was to be expected. 
 
 I placed the jade egg back on the mantle. I still had a few things to finish cleaning up around Gran ’ s house before I left. The whole family had been trying to get things divvied up, or at least cleaned up, around Gran ’ s house over the last few months. We worked one room at a time. Everyone was entitled to make a request for an item. Most items only one or two of us wanted, so we settled it civilly. When there were more heated arguments, we let Gran decide who would get it. Nobody argued with Gran. 
 
 I was the only one around today, just to do cooking and cleaning things like I had always done. Gran had called me into her room and asked, no, ordered me to take the egg and keep it safe. When I was done, I went to say goodbye to Gran, gingerly grabbed the egg, and left, locking the door behind me because the stay-at-home nurse never did. 
 
 I drove the few blocks home and let myself in. My cat Annie rushed to meet me and beg for food. I had been gone longer than usual today. I made my way to my bare mantle, making sure not to step on Annie or any of the other obstacles scattered across my floor. In that moment, I was glad I was still single, because if I had kids, there would be myriad Legos scattered through the house, waiting to send unsuspecting feet into excruciating pain. I made it to my mantle without issue, however, and placed the jade egg in the center, flanking it on its left with a family photo from our last reunion and on its right with a photo of Gran and me. I was sure in time I ’ d have more photos to decorate the mantle, maybe other trinkets. But this simple arrangement was good. 
 
 I fed Annie, had some brownies I had picked up from the store earlier in the week, cleaned up, and went to sleep. It had been a long day, between work and helping Gran. I crashed. 
 
 Annie ’ s sharp claws woke me up at some inhuman hour of the morning. I pushed her off of me, but not before I noticed she was shivering with fear. Nothing scared Annie, so I got up to investigate. No lights were on. I hadn ’ t heard any glass break. 
 
 A tiny glow came from the vicinity of the mantle. My heart began to race as I rushed around the barrier between the kitchen and living room to see what was happening. Nothing was out of place, and the glow was gone, so I dismissed it and went back to sleep. 
 
 The next few days were pretty normal. Annie avoided the fireplace, but other than that all was normal. 
 
 A few nights later, Annie woke me with her claws again. I groggily sat up and this time there was a much brighter glow coming from the living room. I sprung up and raced out there. 
 
 The egg was broken. Coming out of what remained of it was a small, emerald green dragon. Maybe the stories were truer than the family credited them to be.

 “ I just wanted things to be different ” I whimpered, the chains keeping my wrists and ankles bound were cutting off circulation making it hard to speak, “ I just wanted things to change ”. 
 
 When we built Barack Hussein Obama II we didn ’ t know what we were doing. It was about making a difference; it was always about making a difference. AI was still in its early stages, when the visitors introduced it to us. The technology they had given us was far beyond any human construct. There was no doubt in our minds that it was the real thing. Alien hardware infused with secret software was left behind as the spaceship ascended into the skies, and then the visitors were no more. 
 
 Nobody knew what it was, but we knew how to use it. The visitors had left directions that were in English, intending us to use it. The computer scientists I had recruited, collectively boasting 100 years of experience, managed to make it work. We called it the shell. The directions had taught us how to make it change and speak, however they also explicitly stated that once we chose its form there was no changing it back. We had the option to program any type of phenotype expression that we wanted and any kind of ideology, goal, etc. We could make it into the world ’ s greatest predator, or a scientist. But no, we wanted power. We wanted to shape the world, not just help it. 
 
 We worked for days to figure out how to craft the most likeable person in America, recruiting a retired campaign manager from the Reagan days to advise us. He had to appear smart, a good person and overall likable, he also had to be a white Christian male. 
 
 Back and forth, back and forth, I knew we were running out of time, we needed this thing running for at least twenty years if anybody was going to believe it was human. 
 
 “ He needs something that nobody else has, a robot can ’ t just become president, it has to leverage something, it needs a competitive advantage! ” I remember yelling at my team. How foolish I was, investing my blood, sweat and tears, literally and figuratively, into the biggest mistake of my life. 
 
 A few days before the deadline, after 72 hours of reading demographics charts and political scriptures, pushing my men to research alongside me, we had figured out what to do. 
 
 I remember that night clearly. We descended into the basement of the CIA ’ s secret Hawaiian facility, each security checkpoint a chance to turn back. But we continued. And that night, we made the shell half black and switched on the 44th president of the United States.

 Ice cold water hit me in the face. 
 
 “ Wake up. ” Obama commanded, his alien stoicism sending shivers into my soul. Or maybe it was the ice cold water. “ Give me the name of my creators ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t know who they are. Please let me go ” I knew he was going to kill me like the rest of the team if I said anything, but I wasn ’ t going to lie like they did. I wanted to hold on to my life. “ Listen, I didn ’ t realize that sentience would cause you pain. If I knew how to turn you off I would, but really I don ’ t ” I started blubbering, “ Please don ’ t kill me, please! I just wanted to change things, real change “ 
 
 Obama dropped the empty bucket, and began to leave. Before he shut off the lights, he looked at me once more, and a smile slowly spread across his face “ Well, you got your wish ”

165605,"[ WP ] You sold your soul to the Devil years ago . Today he returns it saying , `` I need a favor . ''
","At first I was terrified when he turned up at my work. Joan had buzzed me back in my office telling me I had a visitor at the front desk, and when I made it out there, he greeted me like an old friend. The same man I had seen 10 years ago on the worst night of my life. He had n't aged a day - still indescribably handsome while somehow lacking any remarkable features. 
 
 `` Sammy,'' he cried as I stepped out into the lobby. `` It's been too long!'' He sauntered forth and pushed aside the hand I had automatically extended, instead wrapping me up in a chilling hug. 
 
 `` Scratch,'' I responded weakly. `` How, uh... what a surprise.'' 
 
 `` You always did have a way with words,'' Scratch replied, clapping my back one last time before releasing me from his embrace. `` Come take a walk with me. Joan, Sammy here is taking the afternoon off to buy me a beer so we can catch up. He'll see you tomorrow.'' 
 
 Scratch's words had the effect they always seemed to have on folks, as our normally prickly receptionist beamed at him, and wished me a good afternoon off. It was n't until we were half a block from my office that I finally found my voice again. 
 
 `` Just what is it that you want? You've already taken everything.'' 
 
 `` Sammy! Really, that's the kind of attitude you take with an old friend? Ca n't a guy just want to check up on a buddy he has n't heard from in a decade?'' Scratch held the door open to a bagel shop. I eyed him for a few seconds, but he was utterly unreadable. 
 
 `` Quit with the Sammy shit. My name is Samuel. We're not friends.'' I made my way into the bagel shop and sat at a lonely table in the back. Scratch gave a knowing nod to one of the patrons bundled in rags muttering to himself before plopping down in a chair just a little to close to me. 
 
 `` Fair enough, Samuel. Formality it is if that's what you'd prefer. How's the family?'' 
 
 `` You know damn well how they are. Why are you here?'' 
 
 `` Well, you're quite right about that. I **do** know how they are. And how you've been. And how you've been spending these last years going over and over our little agreement. Googling the path to salvation - I'll confess I had a good laugh when you tried that one,'' Scratch chuckled between bites of a bagel which seemed to materialize into his hand. 
 
 `` So you're here to mock me? Certainly you've got better ways of spending your time.'' 
 
 `` Not really,'' Scratch grinned. `` But I have come to see if you're serious. If you really want it back, I can give it to you. If you're willing to make another deal.'' 
 
 `` No!'' I hissed at him. `` No more deals. I've seen what comes with your deals, and I wo n't be tricked by you again.'' 
 
 `` Tricked! There was no trick involved, Samuel,'' Scratch said, flashing anger. `` I did exactly as I promised to do. Adhered to the very letter of the bargain. And gave you back exactly what your asked for. If you are dissatisfied with our prior arrangement, let me tell you right now that I'm happy to unwind it, and set things back as they were.'' 
 
 `` No no,'' I responded quietly, taken aback. `` I did n't mean to give that impression. Please do n't do anything to them.'' 
 
 `` Right then. As I was saying,'' Scratch said, pausing to take a sip of tea. `` I've seen that you are dissatisfied with how things have worked out for you, and I do hate to leave people with regrets. So I have come to offer up a new bargain, because the simple fact of the matter is, I need a favor. And I'm willing to give you your soul back if you'll do me a service. Tea?'' 
 
 An ornate chalice sat before me on the table, the smell of Earl Grey wafting from it. `` What's the favor?'' 
 
 `` That cup,'' Scratch said. `` There is an upstart that calls himself a preacher running a house of miracles. He has a cup just like this that he uses to turn water into wine down at his little church by the river. I happen to know, of course, that the man is a fraud. But his cup does work - and those that drink from it seal a pact which binds them to eternal damnation. While I respect the motivation, I do n't much appreciate the competition. I need to get the cup in order to find out who gave it to him. That is, who is trying to usurp my position. Just switch that one with it, and get me the original.'' 
 
 I rolled his proposal around in my head. Losing my soul had n't been the nothing I thought it was. I was lost without it. `` I accept your terms,'' I said. 
 
 `` Excellent decision, Samuel,'' Scratch replied. `` Drink your tea.'' 
 
 I started to protest, but knew it would n't matter. I took a sip and felt the warmth spread throughout my body. I guzzled the rest greedily, relishing the feeling of being truly alive once more. The air smelled better, colors looked brighter, the obnoxious pop music blaring from the bagel store's kitchen was just a little less soul-crushing because I had a soul that could be crushed. Scratch smiled and nodded at me, `` Now get to work.'' 
 
 I spent the next several weeks attending services at the Church of the Holy Redemption and observing the ministrations of Reverend Will Wright. It was the typical holy roller stuff, with plenty of exultations about accepting Christ into your heart to find the redemption you are seeking. Most of the congregants that piled into the cramped church seemed to be homeless people and drug addicts, and every other week the Reverend would have them traipse outside to perform a baptism in the river. Every week featured an offer to `` partake in the covenant'' by coming up and drinking from a cup of wine poured from a ewer of water. A line of people would form, and the cup would get passed back and forth, with the Reverend taking a sip from the cup each time before handing it to a parishioner to drink from. I declined to partake both because of what Scratch had told me about the cup, and because the whole thing seemed much too unsanitary. 
 
 I had been trying to work out how to make the switch, when finally one week the Reverend caught up to me as I tried to disappear into the crowd of people leaving after a service. `` Are you lost son?'' he asked me in an almost accusatory voice. 
 
 `` No sir,'' I responded, pointing up the road. `` I've just parked-'' 
 
 `` The first thing to do is quit lying to yourself,'' the Reverend interrupted. `` Everyone that comes to my church is lost. Otherwise they would n't be here.'' 
 
 `` Right,'' I said, smiling uncomfortably. I tried to keep moving with the crowd, but the Reverend grabbed my arm in a surprisingly tight grip. 
 
 `` *What have you lost*?'' the Reverend asked, his eyes pleading with me to be honest. 
 
 `` Nothing,'' I deflected. `` I'm finding it all just be coming here.'' 
 
 `` Divorced?'' 
 
 `` Yes,'' I responded, taken aback. 
 
 `` And your daughter does n't want anything to do with you either. Pray to God earnestly tonight, and you'll have your chance to get your family back.'' 
 
 I stared back at the Reverend confused, before nodding slowly. The Reverend released his grip on my arm and struck up a conversation with another congregant. That night, against my better judgment, I did as he suggested and prayed for the first time in 10 years.

","`` 7212?! Haha what the Hell?!'' 
 
 He laughed to himself as he woke up, rubbing his eyes assuming it was a mistake of some sort, before pushing himself up out of bed to get ready for the day. Sitting on the edge of the bed he thought of what could have possibly lead to this. 
 
 Leaving his room everything seemed normal, he had breakfast, he showered, and went to work. On his drive in he glanced at his glove box, and remembered the night before that he had put the engagement ring for his girlfriend in there, he was planning on proposing tonight. 
 
 He paused and thought, `` could I have messed up so bad and so many times at proposing? No no no, that's ridiculous, 7212 screw up. Maybe it's so amazing that I want to relive it a bunch? But..7212 times? Ehh..maybe? I do n't know'' 
 
 He got to work and parked his car, glanced at the glove box one last time, then got out and lock the car door. He stood still for a few moments looking into the and thought `` could I have forgot the ring 7212 times? Could it have been stolen 7212 times? A combination? ``, and then he unlocked his car door and removed the box from the glove compartment and slipped it into his pocket. 
 
 Walking through the parking lot he saw Linda from finance, she waved at him and he waved back before noticing a car speeding her way. He sprinted and pushed Linda out of the way into the grass beyond a curb, rolling beside her as the red car streaked by, he could hear her thanking him, but all he could think was `` did it take 7212 attempts for me to save Linda?'' 
 
 Finally in the office he sat down and tried his very best to get his work done, typing in some results from other works in Excel, dragging down cells, inserting formulas, nothing out of the ordinary. Although he did have one last slight pause in the day, sending a report to his boss he reviewed the report again and again, making sure he was n't making his 7212th mistake that could cost him his job. But everything seemed fine and normal. 
 
 Later than evening he returned home, readying for his date, the date. Tonight he was going to ask Tanya to marry him, after seven years together, ups and downs, mostly ups. He went back and forth between suit jackets and ties, which one could be the 7212th worst or best ensemble. Eventually he settled on his dark blue suit and a black tie, simple but a bit of color, without being over the top. 
 
 Getting in his car again he drove for the restaurant where he said he'd meet her after work, it was the same restaurant they went to for the first year anniversary together. Pulling up to an intersection he waited for the light to turn green, and when it did he rolled into the intersection only for a car to speed through the intersection, the red car streaking through the red light. Breaking quick he breathed heavily and thought `` was this the first of 7212 tikes he did not get in an accident?'' 
 
 Making it to the restaurant he could see Tanya sitting in their booth already, he stood there and smiled, she looked as beautiful as the day they met. Walking in she laughed and shook her head `` 7:10? 10 minutes late, mister, you're so predictable'', standing up to give him a kiss before sitting back down. He laughed but thought `` could my lateness be why I am at 7212? No, I'm late fairly often, but 10 minutes is nothing.'' 
 
 They ate entrées, talked like teens in love, drank wine, ate their meals, laughed, ate dinner, reminisced, and ordered some cake to end the night. He spoke with the waiter before about having the ring on her plate, he hoped it was n't the 7212th time the waiter stole or lost it. But there it was resting on the plate behind her slice, and after only three bites in she noticed it. Dropping her fork on the table, her eyes watered, he hoped it was n't a 7212th'no', but the smile he wanted to see the rest of his life lit up her face and she screamed `` yes!'' 
 
 They both got up and kissed and held each other, again and again, both teary eyed and laughing. Sitting back down they slowly ate their cake, she spoke and looked her ring over smiling, but he thought `` maybe this? I wanted to live this night again and again.'' 
 
 Awhile later, as the candles on their table were almost gone they left the restaurant, heading to the park up the street where they always walked Sunday mornings. As they crossed the street, Tanya walking backwards a few feet a head talking of their future wedding, he looked in the corner of his eye, then down at his watch, thinking `` I did it! 5 minutes to midnight, I must hav-'' 
 
 A red streaked by and hit Tanya, sending her soaring into the air and back down against the pavement. The car sped off into the night, a broken man stood there briefly in disbelief before running to the motionless body. The smile, gone. The glow, gone. Tanya, gone. He fell to his knees and held her crying, `` n-n-no, no, no, baby, please God..nooooo..n-no, not like this, come back, please, please do n't leave me'', and then the clock struck midnight.

 Minute two, open the door and go inside. Slightly more difficult because of cameras. But, as long as they don ’ t know who you are, you are golden. 
 
 Minutes three through six, figure out where the big guy is. This is the most difficult part. I mean, he doesn ’ t just hang out in a room with a silver plaque that reads: Superhero In Here! 
 
 
 Now, minutes seven and eight are the most important. So be prepared. 
 
 
 Go in that room and *fucking shoot them all*. 
 
 
 Minutes nine and ten are spent making sure no one survived and settling into your super sweet, recently painted with the blood of your enemies, supervillain hideout.

","The Godmage stood ready, magic wrapped around his body. From the tips of his god-like fingers to his very core, this was magic no other mage would ever know; blessed by Gods with nigh-on infinite power, he stood to meet his foe. 
 
 The magi in the College has already fled, like they always have. In the past, before his rise to the warlord he has become, the Godmage would walk into a maelstrom fearless and eager to prove his power and control. Walking from the shells and carcasses, all that remained of the horrors the Evernight could bring to bear, he would feel like the God of Kings. 
 
 Now, in the catacombs beneath the College, the world took on a different tone. Scouts reporting these creatures, called Night Gaunts, said they were impervious to magic. The Godmage still had tricks up his tunic sleeves, god-given secrets and weapons, but if this were true? 
 
 The Godmage, centuries ancient and wise, would fall like any other man. A man of incalculable strength, written in the history books as a creature no nearer to godhood could you stand. As weak as a babe. 
 
 But he would hold the breach while the community fled, and do what he could. No-one expected any different of this immortal man, but he would stand, and fight, and possibly fall. And none would mourn his loss, except as that of a guardian at the gates. 
 
 As the shadows of rags and claws appear around the many corners, the Godmage breathed slowly. If, like all the other Evernighters these Night Gaunts would feed on magic, his corpse would feed them for long enough for the others to escape to the Old World. 
 
 He hoped.

 A gap in the thicket of trees allowed the light to trickle through, revealing a gruesome sight. A bloodied body lay crumpled against the ground.

 “ Yeah, well what can I say? I like breakfast not at breakfast time. Sometimes doing things the wrong ways is what makes them best. ”

 “ Looks alright to me, boss ” Donnie said with a mouthful of English muffin. Jam was crusted all around his lip and you could hear his smacking from tables over.

 “ Heh, yeah, I haven ’ t eaten all day and these hotcakes and jam are really hitting the spot ” he said with a smug smile, chuckling as his cheek protruded out like a squirrel hoarding food for another meal. 
 
 “ Hit the spot, huh? ” he said, his voice deeper than usual. Lou ’ s eyes now fixated on Donnie. His friendly demeanor was gone, his lips tight together, his eyes black as night. “ Funny, I asked you a week ago to do one thing for me and look what day it is, Sunday. Now, normally I wouldn ’ t expect anyone to work on the day of rest, but I made it very clear that this was to be done *on time*. But you said had n't eaten all day, right?

 `` No. No you did n't. I can see it in your face. The way you're stuffing your fucking mouth, the way you're cowardly eating like this could be the last meal.

","They said they had to use separated twins. That way the data would be quantifiable, comparable and ultimately useful. 
 
 I understood that, my brother did too, but it did n't make the initial separation much easier. He was assigned to vault 69, I was assigned to 68. I said that it made sense that way, since he a was minute older than me, he said it made sense for other reasons too and proceeded to make a lot of juvenile innuendoes about 69s. I told him to shut up. God I miss that. 
 
 We volunteered for this, to be separated in experimental vaults to compare our reactions and the ultimate outcome. We both thought we'd end up in vaults with lots of other separated twins. We speculated that perhaps they wanted to see if the same twins paired up with each other in each vault. A mirror effect on relationships within a contained environment. Or something like that. 
 
 It did n't quite work out that way. I am the only woman in a vault otherwise comprised entirely of men. It's exactly as you'd expect. My existence boils down to chains, degradation and dirt. Pain and beatings, pain and humiliation. Rinse and repeat. 
 
 Each day when I go to sleep, if they let me sleep, I press my face to the wall. I imagine my brother in the neighbouring vault, I wonder if he's doing the same thing. Our faces separated only by a few hundred thousand tons of concrete, steel and irradiated earth. 
 
 I wonder if the single woman in his bunker misses her brother too. Maybe she does n't even have a twin brother. After all, the twin theory makes zero sense now anyway. I'm guessing they only wanted to split us up to remove any allegiances between inhabitants. They knew he would defend me to the death, so better to split us up straight away and spare everyone the inconvenience. Better to spare one man from wasting his life for the sake of a worthless sex object. That's clearly how the sick designer of these experiments views women. What the hell were they expecting? `` Visit Vault 68, it's a utopia for people who love reverse harem rape fantasies. Come for the soul destroying misery, stay for the sexual frustration.'' 
 
 The men here do n't really have allegiances. Sure, they operate as a collective. Each waiting patiently for his time and performing his maintenance jobs like a good little drone. But they do n't trust each other, see? You can tell because when one has had his turn he almost always has this look on his face like he thinks I belong to him more than any of the others. It's that self-satisfied look of underserved dominance and self-deluding machismo. Yeah buddy, you did it. You had forced sex with someone who was strapped to a table. I bet your mother's radiation infused corpse is real proud. 
 
 I just hope my brother can still see the woman behind the chains and straps in his vault. God, tell me he does n't have that same empty look in his eyes when his number is called and he gets to take his turn in the fucked-up bullshit rape lottery. 
 
 More than anything, I pray for the day when someone else's brother has the courage to murder me. 
 
 And maybe my brother can do the same for her.

The office building had three floors, two of which looked more like rubble than building. 
 
 Starting at one end of the first floor Josh meticulously searched. He had a routine, a pattern, clear one room and move to the next. It was a routine he learned 13 years ago when he became part of Los Angeles search and rescue team. Starting out at 18 this was all he's ever known, all he's ever wanted to do. And he did it well. 
 
 Clearing the first room he goes to the next. His team following behind him. In room two he finds a woman trapped under a desk. He calls over Ramirez and Johnson to help lift the desk while he moves the woman. Once free two more men stabilize her and get her out of the building. Josh is already onto the next room. 
 
 He's driven, focused. He knows what he's doing and he wants to save people. He clears the rest of the first floor before an after shock shakes the building. He can hear screams from upstairs and he continues on. Finding 5 more survivors on the second floor Josh is worried what he will find on the third. He keeps pushing forward. 
 
 The third floor is completely unrecognizable. There are no rooms, only chaos. He starts moving but the building shakes again. He knows it is becoming more and more unstable. But he refuses to give up. Half way through the third floor part of the roof collapses. He's cut off from his team. Radio communication is spotty but strong enough that he keeps searching. It's his job to clear the building and he will do it. 
 
 In the last room he find the sole survivor of the third floor. A woman who could be his grandmother. As the building shakes again he knows he must act fast. He goes to the nearest window and calls down to his team. He's going to lower her out the window. The team gets in place at the bottom of the window. Josh puts a harness on her and clips her in. He lifts her out the window and slowly starts lowering her down. 
 
 As she reaches the bottom another after shock shakes the building. The building starts to collapse. Josh has to get out and get out fast. He fastens his rope to an exposed beam and runs for the window. He leaps out grabbing his rope as he falls. His grip tightens and he stops sliding just 7 feet off the ground. He lands softly and gets away from the building just as it caves in.

His only problem was his terrible incompetence. He was a sweet kid with a lot of heart too, but the little guy could n't do much of anything right. The other villagers even went so far has to label him a'bumbling idiot' Little Leo knew what the others thought of him, but he never let that stop him from perusing his dream. He believed in himself, just as his father always had. 
 
 Druid recruitment was less than three months away and he knew he had a lot of work a head of him if he was ever going to keep up with the best of the best. He was diligent in his training; reading several volumes of shamanistic literature, transmutation text, and Druidicial rules and procedures until his vision blurred. He ran five miles around the village and surroundings forest every day to keep his body at peak conditions as well. Although he was very small, towards the end of this training he had become quite muscular. 
 Finally the day of the recruitment ceremony arrived. Leo arrived early to the field where the recruits were to meet. One by one the applicants filed in to await the Druid commander. Leo scanned his competition, everyone there was a good three feet taller than him and most of them looked like they really knew their stuff. He wiped a bead of nerve induced sweat of his brow and focused forward toward the podium as the illustriously renowned druid elite commander stepped up. 
 
 He pulled a sheet of paper from his coat, laid it onto the podium, and cleared his throat as he began to read from the paper. 
 
 
 `` Attention new recruits, it is my unfortunate duty to inform you that the writer of this short story that you are a part of has lost interest in finishing it, and for that he is terribly sorry. 
 In any case, this story was to resolve itself with little Leonardo sacrificing that which he held most precious, his dream of becoming a druid like his father because he to take care of his mom because she got sick or something. That is all. `` 
 
 And with that final sentence, the paper the commander was reading from vanished into thin air, followed by the podium it was resting on, followed by the commander himself, until every person, animal, and physical object in the village and the entire world vanished into a bleak white slate of perpetual nothingness.

There was the bum, shuffling aimlessly on the dark side of the station- high on drugs of some sort, Mr. Rasp supposed, though he didn ’ t care to ask. There stood, far too close to the edge of the platform, a happy couple, hand in hand, their echoes whispering through the station, in love wherever they went- even when staring out at the sea of trash that covered the train tracks. 
 
 Mr. Rasp thought about how things used to be. He knew she was waiting for him- he stared at the stairs to his right, that led up and out to the city streets. “ *I can go, * ” he thought, missing the way that things used to be. 
 
 The distant howl of the approaching train began to swallow the station; the bum, walking in indolent circles, didn ’ t notice the noise or light coming from the far side of the tunnel, nor did it matter. The train skidded to a halt, blowing a small wave of discarded newspapers from the tracks onto the platform. The gray thing ’ s doors ground open as though they were made of stone, and the happy couple floated into it, like a pair of wings seeking an angel. 
 
 The doors, slowly, began sliding back together, snapping shut at the last second. The train groaned back to life, and slowly began to depart the station as- 
 
 “ Crap! ” A shrill voice swore, accompanied by a little cascade of angry footsteps that echoed through the station as they pounded their way down the concrete stairway into the subway station. A small woman with red hair and a large, practical white purse ran into the station just in time to watch the train ’ s glowing tail vanish into the darkness. 
 
 She gasped and leaned against the dingy wall, too late to catch the train and trying to catch her breath- 
 
 “ Miss your train? ” Mr. Rasp asked. 
 
 She nodded. “ It looks like I ’ m not going home anytime soon. ” 
 
 “ That makes two of us, ” smiled Mr. Rasp. “ You get caught in traffic? ” 
 
 
 “ No, work ran a little long, and I- ” she glanced at the bum at the far side of the station- “ I got a little lost, ” she sat on the bench beside Mr. Rasp, setting her purse between the two of them. 
 
 “ Ah, I hear you. I missed the train too. ” 
 
 “ Oh, did you fall asleep? ” 
 
 “ No, I sat here, did some thinking, and realized that what I was looking for- I wouldn ’ t catch it on that train, ” he said, gazing at the spot where the happy couple once stood. 
 
 “ Wait, you missed your train on purpose? ” 
 
 Mr. Rasp nodded. `` I did it for a girl.'' 
 
 `` Oh, how romantic'' she said with a toothy smile, `` is she here?'' she asked, quickly glancing back and running her right hand through her thick red hair, her left hand pulling the purse from between the two of them and onto her lap. 
 
 `` No, she's in Newark,'' replied Mr. Rasp as he took his hands from his pockets, stretched, and stood up to walk towards the stairs, leaving behind a ring, and a little pile of [ paint chips ] ( https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=9E6Zj9weY_w ).

There were stories written with its great glow and calm control of the mighty seas as inspiration for any number of great things. The people of Earth loved their moon more than any other part of their world: more than the sun which bathed them in warmth and more than the Earth which raised them. The moon was the people's as much as their own skins. 
 
 Hungry from their love, the people of Earth took fantastic risks to meet their moon. They flew incredible machines to make their journey, and they called it `` a leap for mankind.'' After that leap, the people rested - preparing for something greater - something more. When again mankind lept, they reached out and grabbed. They would not the moon slip from their grasp again! Mankind took hold and pulled itself forward, forward, never to return.

The widow was in fashion for selling deals and if you knew how to ask and trade, well sometimes you got exactly what you wanted. Other times, you came back with a bit more than you bargained for and in the worst cases visitors did n't make it out at all. 
 
 The front door was just about off its hinges as I creaked up the worn oak steps. An owl sat on the bare dark wood tree near the home entrance, it surveyed me with a piercing gaze and then gave a single hoot. I had my hand inches away from the door when it slid open on its own accord. A long hallway stretched into the room at the end, which was shrouded in darkness. 
 
 `` Hello?'' I called. 
 
 The silence swallowed up the noise and left an eerie energy in its place. I pulled my shirt straight and then nodded. It was go hard or go home and home was a hell of a stretch from here. 
 
 Each step forward sent a creak through the floorboards. I paused halfway down the hallway to check above me and the walls on either side. The feeling of being watched remained with me like poised knives behind my back. 
 
 The front door slammed shut. I spun toward the noise but saw no one in the rays of sunlight that broke through the gaps above and below the door. I moved forward with whatever courage I could find, the main room was mere steps away. 
 
 `` Who dares to come into my home?'' a voice asked from the main room. It had a sharp tone to it and reminded me of an old crone. There was no doubt that this was the woman. 
 
 The floorboard beneath my foot gave a loud creak as I inched forward. 
 
 `` As you wish, come forth,'' the witch said. 
 
 It was n't that I was afraid of her. It was that none of the stories had mentioned the sound of the witches voice or what she looked like. It brought to the surface a sneaking suspicion that I might have been the first visitor in a while -- if not the only one. 
 
 `` My name is Travis. Travis Locke, a mage from the North County.'' 
 
 `` Ahhh,'' the witch cooed. `` Well, show yourself Travis, and then we shall begin our negotiation.''

You 're just no fun to waste a violent impulse on , they tell you . So you 've had to find other ways to pass the time . . .
","**The Department of Mundane Vassals** 
 
 Fuck bureaucracy, right? But you have no idea because you're still alive. If you think spending a Saturday afternoon in line at the DMV sounds torturous, try and imagine the experience with time removed from the equation. You spent an eternity at the DMV? I have literally spent an eternity in line at the DMV. The DMV is Hell? Well, no. But, there are quite a few down here. 
 
 
 Hell is every possible type of suffering that you can attempt to conceive. However, you can not imagine the full extent of what that is. Attempt to contemplate infinity. Ok cool, now let's make imagine that inifinity is `` suck-age''. Hell is a negative infinity. It never stops getting worse and everything is suffering. Hell does n't blow, it scrapes with teeth. The lucky ones just get tortured. Yes, the lucky ones. I am in line at the D.M.V. for the fifth time this week, a cumulative wait of two thousand years, and I expect to have my forms rejected once more. In Hell, time does n't pass or correlate with its passing in other dimensions. It solely exists for torture: short-term deadlines and incredibly long waits. 
 
 Hell is a well oiled machine ( that should not work at all because of all this fucking bureaucracy ). A doomed individual has three possible outcomes: 
 
 1. The good are subject to forced labor and eternal torture. They power `` the machine''. 
 
 2. The overwhelming majority of evil souls have the same fate as the good, except for the select few. The promising are selected for demonhood and sent off to a bootcamp. You have the wrong idea of who they choose. They want real talent. Hitler and similar folks are somebody's bitch in the mines. You want a real demon? Einstein, he's an ideal candidate, too smart and easily bored. 
 
 3. Then there are the left overs, the mundane and average existences. These souls are no good when it comes to torture or forced-labor ( very inefficient effort to output ratio ), and are ill-suited for demonic work. The mundane occupy unimportant roles that keep the whole thing moving: interns, assistants, middle-level managers, couriers, etc.. Sometimes they promote the least proficient mundane into the demon ranks, giving them status and freedom as a way to torture everyone else. 
 
 
 I am a mundane soul. I am almost the most mundane soul, which is a big deal if you're trying to make demon. I used to work in a dry cleaners. But, last week I received a memo from the great demon Aamon ( sent by courier, of course ) that I had been reassigned as a demon's assistant. Serving a demon is supposedly great fun, by the standards of Hell. There is the occasional dark and evil shit, you know the hollywood-esque stuff: vandalisms and kidnapping and sacrifices and possesions. But mostly, the demon's have you furthering their more benign, devious and perverted goals: *Three thai hookers, one must have one arm, and some pizza from New York City. While gathering this for me, two hundred people must piss themselves*. 
 
 The last mundane to be promoted into demonhood was given that exact to-do list. Needless to say, I am as excited as on can be in Hell. So, here I am waiting in line at the Department of Mundane Vassals. Eventually my paperwork shall process and I will be presented to my lord demon; likely after another week of being delayed.... 
 
 Except the mundane soul behind the DMV desk is pointing at me, in the very back of his line, and frantically alerting his lesser-demon boss. 
 
 Imagine that you have bundled six hundred and sixty six sparklers of varying colors together and ignited them with gasoline whilst standing three feet away. This is what it is like when a demon teleports next to you. The soft *Wssssshhhhhhh* and smell of one lesser demon teleporting to you is nothing like working dry cleaning during a weekend rush ( demons like suits, and they stain them a lot ). But, being spoken to directly by a demon of any level is incredibly unnerving... 
 
 `` So, how is your DMV experience so far? You like waiting?'' You never admit to liking or disliking something in Hell. If addressed by someone or something that outranks you, always answer with the appropriate courtesy. `` My demon superior, it has been an experience.'' 
 
 `` You have been granted a rather important position, for a fucking nobody.'' This was not what I wanted to hear. `` We're all waiting for you to fuck it up, because it would be broadcast of course. You've been assigned as the assistant to Demon President Buer. Your certification has been updated and here is a license of dimensional travel. Your work clears you for almost all of hell, and you have been granted a surface world pass as well. Man, we ca n't wait for you to fuck this up.'' 
 
 
 It's Hell, so this is n't good, it's forebodingly interesting. I gaped at the license in my hand, granting me access to the world of the living, and heard the demon begin to chuckle... 
 
 `` As your first task, the Demon President would like one jelly donut. Oh, and you are being sent to 14th century France to procure this. I suggest running someone over with a motor vehicle while obtaining it, as a gesture of goodwill. Have fun.''

","Out in the dark winter night, the wind howled. 
 
 
 It was n't the wind that bother Harold, however. No, that was safely outside, vainly rattling the window frame with impotent fury. Nor was it the cold, kept at bay by four thick walls and a roaring fire in the hearth. In fact, his tiny cabin was positively a beacon of Yuletide cheer, a shining light burning despite the frigid world just outside. 
 
 He pulled his knees closer to his chest. 
 
 
 Oblivious to both the raging storm and his father's obvious discomfort, little James played contentedly on the rug. His toy, a little wooden racing car that his father had given him as an early Christmas present, rolled across the floor on noisy wheels. James smiled happily, firelight glinting off of his platinum-blonde hair as he crashed his car into his hand. 
 
 
 *Just like Diana's* Harold thought wistfully. He shivered slightly, despite the warmth. 
 
 
 Harold had loved his wife. He had loved her with all his heart. They had been high school sweethearts, learning to love while many of their classmates just learned to drive. It was hard, but they had been happy. At least at first. 
 
 
 *But that was n't really my fault, was it? * Harold's mind wandered onto a well-worn mental path. *There was nothing I could do. * 
 
 
 It was only after James had been nearly two that they had their first fight. Harold wanted another child, a girl this time to complement their son. Diana, on the other hand, had had enough. James was a difficult pregnancy, and she had been ill for nearly the entire time she was carrying him. `` Having another would just be too hard on me!'' she had said a dozen times... no, a hundred times. Despite himself, Harold smiles at the memory of her golden locks shaking, beautiful even in her anger. Maybe especially so. 
 
 
 Eventually, she had relented. Harold was overjoyed, even more so a few months later when he found that not only was he having one daughter, but two! Two beautiful baby girls, to love and cherish. Sisters for his son to watch over as they grew together. That was how it was supposed to be. 
 
 
 But Diana was less than thrilled. If James' pregnancy was difficult, bringing twins into the world was a world of hell. Illness after illness, hospital after hospital, their relationship was chipped away piece by piece even as the girls grew within her. 
 
 
 *It would have gone back, once they were born* Harold assured himself. *She still loved me, I know she did*. 
 
 
 Then, one cold, dark winter night, everything had gone wrong. On the way back from the hospital in Harold's car, they hit a patch of frozen ground invisible in the dark and spun out into the forest. They the tree hard, crushing the passenger door and throwing Harold through the windshield and into the woods. He had lived, with little more than a broken leg. But his wife and unborn daughters had been trapped, pinned to the twisted metal even as the car had erupted into flames. 
 
 
 *It was n't my fault. I did everything I could to save them* Harold hugged his knees tighter, scars pulling on the thick material of his pants. *It was n't my fault! * 
 
 
 The wind stopped. 
 
 
 
 Harold looked up suddenly, wiping the tears that streaked his cheeks on his warm fleece sleeve. 
 
 
 `` James, get your coat. It's time to go.'' 
 
 
 `` Ok daddy!'' The child smiled happily, running to the rack by the door where his heavy winter jacket hung. Behind him, the window flooded with moonlight to reveal a vast mountain valley, as picturesque as a Christmas card. Yet in the distance, a patch of shadow seemed to ignore the moonlight. 
 
 
 Harold turned away nervously. `` Ready to get some hot soup, little man?'' He tittered. 
 
 
 `` Hot soup!'' James yelled, raising his arms and letting his jacket fall into place. Harold quickly fastened the jacket closed, its bulk making James' already considerable bulk look even wider. `` C'mon, we got ta hurry before they close!'' Harold eyed the window again. The shadow seemed larger and more distinct than before. 
 
 
 `` Hurry, hurry!'' James sang, pulling on his gloves and hat and shoving his toy car into a warm pocket. Harold took his hand, and together they opened the door and walked out into the night. 
 
 
 The air was still and quiet. Great fat snowflakes, like balls of cotton or cloud, fell from the night sky to join their kind in silent heaps. Harold doggedly pushed onward, his eyes never straying from the road. 
 
 
 `` Look daddy! It's mommy!'' 
 
 
 Harold stopped. He glanced sideways at his son, who was pointing at something in the distance behind the cabin. Reluctantly, slowly, Harold turned. 
 
 
 
 In the distance, a human shaped figure stood silhouetted in the moonlight, dwarfing the mountains it stood upon. Its limbs were stretched, far beyond what any living person might have. On its shoulders rested three separate heads, twisted and tortured with eyes like distant fire and hair tangled in burned-looking clumps. Then, as if blown away by a gust of wind, the figure vanished as if it had never been there at all. 
 
 
 *You came closer this year than ever before* Harold thought, turning away. *Someday, I promise I will see you again. Like you used to be. * 
 
 
 With a start, he realized that he was holding a lock of long platinum-blonde hair. 
 
 
 *I'm coming. I promise. *

","The judge's hammer came down with a crack. The stale courtroom air wavered tentatively, finally giving sway to an cymbalic echo. Like the last note of a long and enduring drum solo. 
 
 `` The use of humans for perpetual emotional energy is hereby outlawed in the United States of America,'' 
 
 Not a person moved. Nobody cheered. Eyes did not blink. 
 
 The Judge continued. 
 
 `` Citing the case of the youth Vs congress. Under close scientific scrutiny, the many individuals who have given, of their free will, emotional energy to the National Power Grid, have been deemed emotionally defunct yet functionally cognitive persons.'' 
 
 It would take a few generations to regain the lost emotions. Everyone from 15 years old to 60+ had been hooked up to the grid regularly. It paid very well. 
 
 The complete loss of emotions happened slowly. The thing is, people did n't really need their emotions to perform daily tasks. They would rise, plug in, then go to work. It was n't noticeable in jobs that demanded very little effort. Fast food workers became more productive. 
 
 Crime and drug use nearly halted. Heavy addicts seemed to take the drugs out of habit, much like a person who loses their memory still remembers how to tie a shoe. 
 
 It was the children who cried out. Not yet old enough to connect to the grid, but just now coming into the emotional hell of puberty. They would watch as friends would become old enough to hook into the grid, then slowly lose that spark of life. Some started putting up online journals to explain the slow process, to warn the younger ones not to plug into the grid. 
 
 It took many generations to organize. Once somebody rose into leadership, they would be connected by parents or by law. Then the struggle to fight would fall below radar. 
 
 It started as a whisper, this Emotional Power Grid repeal act. An online, ever growing case to end the struggle. Every online blog would mention it. Those who found it tinkered with it. Added testimonies. Every other noted urged the wording to be precise. 
 
 When the time was right, take it through the legal system. It failed many times. But it only needed to succeed once. By the time it passed, those who took it to court had no more emotions.

","The commune had just ended, all of the gods meeting to get their new assignments as well as their ratings from the past millennium. Diluvian looked over his paper, a glowing review of his handling of the growing species on Vega 16, masterful use of prophets and intervention to move them through three separate technological revolutions in a millennium. Not bad for his first assignment. 
 
 New gods were n't common; only one or two showing up every cycle. Each time a new god showed up, a few retired. The usual protocol for a new god was to put them in a hands-off position with an established species. They would watch the result of the previous God's actions and read up on how everything worked, by the end of their first cycle, they were ready to take some risks. After all, what was a species or two to train a god? 
 
 Diluvian had n't been a fan of taking his time, slipping into a growing species early and doing his best to shape them in the way he saw fit. They worked out spectacularly, and he'd managed to get his pick of the litter for this cycle, and to everyone's surprise, he decided to try his hand at humanity. 
 
 Humanity was a mixed bag when it came to their treatment of Gods, they were loyal to a fault, which meant it was very hard to convince them that a new God had showed up, a lot of the systems that had been in place thousands of years ago were still up and running, and very against change.

Yhwh tried for a second term but left when they killed his fucking kid. Most demi-gods got worshipped, Jesus got nailed to a cross. 
 
 A species was seen as established when they were atheist, or only had a single god that they believed in.cHumans were in a weird place, they were advanced enough to be established by miles, but they lacked the cohesion. They refused to give up the old ways, and the two hands-off Gods that had stepped up over the last 2000 years had n't helped. 
 
 Diluvian looked over the small blue planet and smiled when a god smiled the stars got bright, and they were beaming. Humanity was going to be the species that he used to crack the ascendant barrier, get an accolade that he led a species to a galactic presence, it was a good plaque to have on the office wall. 
 
 The god pointed his hand towards earth and slowly clenched it, the days turning to weeks as static built up in the sky; water was pulled from the ocean and nearly covered the planet in clouds. He could see the news stations speaking across the globe about the strange weather, about the need for rain, about the droughts. 
 
 In his left hand, he held the water of the world, in his right hand the lightning. He took a second to think about what he needed to say. The language of gods was unique in that nobody could misinterpret it, anybody could read it and know exactly what the writer intended. He relaxed his left hand, and the clouds across the world became black; The rain poured down, there was a mix of floods and salvation in the first day, and then mostly floods in the second. 
 
 He released his grip on the lightning and the planet cracked with thunder. Across the continents, in each place it needed to be, the lighting wrote a message in the ground. 
 
 `` Find your god.'' 
 
 Across the world, the leaders met. All of them had read the message and saw the same thing. There was a new power in town, and the mortals had yet to impress him.

270690,"[ WP ] A young man stands on a bridge , holding a family heirloom
","I stood at the railing and stared downward. The water below was so still that I wondered how it could guarantee death. I supposed death was better than having to deal with any sort of disability a failed attempt would make. 
 
 I contemplated the past few months, the amount of pain I ’ d been through had been almost unbearable. In fact, it had been unbearable. I stared out at the distance and stared at the still lake. How could the lake remain calm next to this much pain? Was there any such thing as pathetic fallacy outside of books? Well, I know this was pathetic and recently it had felt like my feelings are one big fallacy. 
 
 I started to think of the funeral, the amount of people, the tension in the air despite the kind words. The uncomfortable feeling that things would never be the same. I was more than aware of that. I knew things would never be the same. Fact of the matter is I didn ’ t understand life anymore and I knew I could not carry on as normal. There would always be a weight on my back that I could never shift. But I had morbid curiosities that lead me to try and understand it. I wouldn ’ t be here if I hadn ’ t thought that through. 
 
 The weird thing about it is, I had always thought of life as a beautiful thing. I think that ’ s why I had lived the way I have but my fatal mistake came in not noticing when I ’ d crossed my own boundaries. I was scared to settle down, I knew deep down I was not stable enough and that it was a recipe for disaster. What kind of father only tells his daughter he loves her after he has stumbled in at one o ’ clock in the morning stinking of Jack Daniels? Sometimes you don ’ t always choose the things you love most and although I loved her more than anything I still chose Jack Daniels. 
 
 Although stood here it was difficult, I had to think of the good times. I had caught my wife practising her smile in the mirror. I remember that same smile on my daughters face when she first met Santa Clause at the Christmas festival. I remember her first babble of what sounded like words. I remember her tentative first steps holding on to a trolley. I remember my mother telling me I would always have a home there. I remember my daughter crying into my arms as I told her I wasn ’ t mad I was just worried and feeling that unconditional need to protect her. 
 
 Oh shit. 
 
 Remembering that last one took me back a few steps, staring down again at the lake I could imagine the pain surging through her heart already. Everything in me told me to go back, to do better, and to be stronger but I knew I needed this. One thing I ’ d learned is that sometimes pain is there to teach you a lesson and sometimes it is just there like an appendix with the on-going potential to burst. 
 
 I had been through almost every emotion a human being possibly could. I had been mad at my family, I had been mad at the locals, I ’ d been mad at God, I had most of all been mad at myself, I ’ d been mad at my daughter which was the worst of all. We have different ways of acting when it comes to life changing and my first was anger. Actually, perhaps anger isn ’ t the right word. Maybe it was misdirected despair, though that may just be me trying to justify myself unjustly. 
 
 I had been through depression, I had counted the many reasons I should be and deserved every night. My dreams were haunted, my life was haunted. I couldn ’ t turn anywhere without there being a reminder of just how desperately miserable I was. Every morning was like head butting a brick wall, a brick wall ten foot high I had to climb. It hurt to breathe as it seemed pointless. I didn ’ t deserve the air. 
 
 After depression comes complete numbness, which in its own way is a relief but in others it is even worse. I was impervious to the help offered by others. I would sit in the same chair all day just staring out the window not allowing anything to break my concentration. I knew I was hurting everyone around me but there was nothing I could do. Every move was an ache in my muscle that reminded me there was blood pumping around my body and thus reminding me I had a heart, and that it was breaking. 
 
 I put one hand on the railing and despite it being a mildly warm day the metal bar still left a chill on my palm. Perhaps it was nature ’ s way of sending a warning. In my other pocket I took out a picture of my daughter, I had enough time in the world here to stand and look at it. She was my world and the one thing that made it hurt to stand here but I just need to feel something, anything. The picture I had was her most recent high school picture and I felt when I looked at it long enough I saw pain in her eyes. She had an endearing smile, a snaggle tooth on the right side of her mouth she ’ d had since first school. She begged for braces but I was always hesitant as that snaggle tooth had become a part of her and every time she smiled it was a reminder that she was my little girl. 
 
 I remember her asking me about heaven, she had a fascination with the supernatural so I had told her I ’ d let her know. She smiled at this and I held her close, granted I ’ d had some whiskey but she never judged me for it. I think that made it worse. 
 
 When you watch your family get older and change it is a very difficult thing, it ’ s difficult to keep a marriage going and keep it strong and you often worry you ’ re staying out of comfort rather than love. Standing here I knew I loved her, despite the arguments and the poison we spat at each other, I loved every single thing about her and I ached at the thought of her in pain but I needed this and I knew that. Seeing my daughter grow up and become distant was difficult, she was either erratic or withdrawn or somehow both. It took me to now to realise she had a penchant for long sleeved shirts and I worked out why. I blamed myself for that, I blamed myself for everything. 
 
 I though back on everything in my life, from my very first memory of my mother reading me a book about Noah ’ s ark. I thought of first school crying because my first milk tooth had fallen out and I didn ’ t understand why and I had visions of having to wear dentures like my grandfather. My middle school years where I had my first crush, though I ’ m not sure it was genuine but rather because I felt I should have a crush. My high school and college years where I really blossomed and I think this is where my thirst for life began. Maybe I reached my peak too soon and I had lived the rest of my life trying to get that back whilst also slowly losing hope that I would. I remember my wedding and although it was one of the best days of my life, the adrenaline was 10x that of a bungee jumper. Bungee jumper. Jumper. 
 
 
 I took my hand off the railing and held the other side of the picture of my daughter on it “ I ’ m so sorry ” I said. “ I wish things could be different but they aren ’ t. Please forgive me. ” 
 And with that, I knelt down to pick up the urn and scattered her ashes over the railings and placed the picture next to the flowers below me. I reached into my other pocket and pulled out a note “ To my beautiful girl, I hope you are now free from pain. Please tell me what heaven is like. Love, dad ”

16613,"[ WP ] Jesus actually had 14 disciples but their behavior was deemed inappropriate by biblical scholars , so they were removed from the final versions of the Gospels . They are Brad and Chad , the Bro-ciples , and these are their stories .
","1.At that time, Jesus brought his apostles to him, for he had rolled a joint. It was known among the followers of Jesus that his father was the best among all growers, so it was with great haste that the apostles gathered round him. 2.Once all had taken their places, Jesus held his joint aloft, for all to see. `` Fetch me a light,'' he declared; and it was done. 3.Jesus did take the first drag, christening the joint with his christly lips. `` Into this doobie I have rolled the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.'' He then did pass to the right. 4.The apostle Peter did accept and toke of this blessed joint, passing it on to his brother Andrew, who passed it on to James. From James it passed to John, and from John to Phillip. Phillip passed it to Bartholomew, who passed it to the apostle Chad. 5.It was now that the hazy silence was broken. Chad did toke of the Holy Spirit, though his face revealed his confusion. 6.And he did ask Jesus, `` J, how can that be? How can we be smoking the Son, when you are sitting right in front of me, bro?'' 7.Chad did pass the joint to the apostle Brad, who carried on; `` Ya bro, like, there is no way you could ever fit inside of a joint. I mean, you're a grown man. And especially after all that P90X we've been repping. You're looking swol, JC, am I right, boys?'' 8.The other apostles let out a WHOOP WHOOP; Brad did indeed receive an amen. 9.All, that is, except for Judas Iscariot, seated to the left of Jesus. He rubbed his own brow with thumb and forefinger for a moment, before glaring at the apostles Brad and Chad. 10. `` You fools!'' He declared, `` The Holy Spirit is not him physically! He is a man, made holy by his spirit, which comes from the Lord, his father!'' 11.Chad was taken aback. `` So my spirit comes from my father?'' Brad did question further, `` Maybe that's why your mom always says you have n't got any!'' 12.The apostle Brad did expose his knuckles to the apostle Thomas, and the knuckles of the hands of the two apostles did touch. 13.Brad the turned to Jesus, `` JC, sick doobie, bro, but it's running a bit. Just let me-'' 14.Judas did cut him off. `` Pass the goddamn joint already! The Lord is your father! Your spirit comes from him!'' 15.Brad, now, was taken aback. `` The Lord is not my father, bro! Ephithius is my father. Ephithius Johnson. I look just like him and everything. And besides, my mom ai n't like that, bro.'' 16.It was now that the apostle Chad appeared to have received a revelation from the Lord. `` So, like, if my spirit is holy then can I roll and smoke myself, too? J, you're gon na have to show me how to do that, bro! That is some next level shit!'' 17.Brad did struggle with demons. `` Maybe she is like that. I mean, I do n't know. I mean, she did leave the house at night a lot. And Ephithius was never really around until I was like 13.'' 18.It was at this time that the joint did reach Judas; it was but little more than a roach. Judas did throw up his hands and exclaimed, `` Jesus Christ! Well, that's just great!'' He did stand, and like a departing storm he did depart from the room. 19.Bartholemew did call after him, `` Judas, thou art a cunt!'' at which Judas did raise his middle finger, not looking back. 20. `` J, bro, totally not your fault. That was super uncool of Judas. You rolled an awesome J, J, bro,'' the apostle Chad did console. Brad helped, `` Ya, bro. Wicked J. Stellar performance bro.''

238775,"[ WP ] You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago , today he gives it back and says , `` I need a favor '' .
","The blare of my cellphone alarm cuts through my sleep, sending the pieces of a very erotic dream scattering into the realm of half-guilty-half-annoyed wakefulness. Greg Watson, love of my life and perfect boyfriend, wraps his arm gingerly around me. I turn over to face him and feel a huge wave of affection. Our cat Pamplemousse has taken refuge on his head, and all that is left of my favorite face in the world is his nose. I give it a quick kiss and chuckle at the ensuing crinkle, then reluctantly unravel myself from him. 
 
 I run through my Monday morning routine in a grudging stupor, unwilling to detach myself from the weekend cocoon of doing absolutely nothing and everything with Greg and our cat. 
 
 I exit the shower, the last comforts of the weekend dripping off my body. I feel like the walking dead. I proceed to look into the mirror, and what I see jolts me right back to life. Through my mirror I spot *him*. Tall, perfectly contoured and stupid handsome, the devil sat perched on my toilet bowl. I swivel around. He grins at me a crooked, dimpled grin. 
 
 `` What do you want?'' I sigh, locking the bathroom door. 
 
 `` I would n't bother doing that,'' he croons. `` He's a heavy sleeper, your man.'' 
 
 He pulls out a shrivelled avocado out of thin air. 
 
 `` What's that?'' 
 
 `` Your soul,'' the devil says lightly. `` I'm here to give you back your soul.'' 
 
 `` My soul is a dried up -'' I begin. 
 
 `` Yes, yes, a rotten avocado,'' he says. `` But more importantly I'm here to give it back. I need a flava fav.'' 
 
 `` What do you want?'' I'm getting anxious. Greg would be waking up soon. Greg. Love of my life. Man of my dreams. My soulmate. The soulmate I had sold my soul to the devil for. 
 
 The devil pats himself down a couple of times. Sticking his hand into his trench coat, he pulls out a sleeping tabby cat. It is a soft peach color and the size of a burrito. 
 
 `` Quick, take her while she's asleep!'' he whispers fervently. I stare blankly at him. The devil thrusts the cat into my arms. Somewhere beyond the haze of processing what the hell was happening, I realize that the devil has not reacted to my stark nakedness at all. The cat purrs slightly in her sleep. 
 
 `` I thought it was a good idea. Cute little sidekick and all. Named her Cerberus Jr. *Worst* idea I've had in a couple of eons. Please, please just take it away from me. Here, take this too.'' The devil shoves the shrivelled avocado into my hand. 
 
 `` So you want me to keep the cat? Is that your favour?'' I say. 
 
 `` Cat, demon, whatever you want to call it. Yes. You've done a damn good job with yours. Figured Pamplemousse would like a friend. Okay I got ta go, duty calls.'' 
 
 `` Wait, wait wait!'' 
 
 `` What? What?'' The devil turns around, his thick brows furrowed. 
 
 `` Um, you're not going to take Greg away from me, are you?'' I whisper. The devil looks bewildered. `` I know I asked you for a soulmate in return for my soul. I know that. And now that I have my soul back, is n't there some sort of transaction process? I mean, I get it. I love him so much, you know? I think he's going to ask me to marry me, but I do n't think I can say yes. I love him so much. He's so perfect for me. But I feel so guilty. Like his love is n't real. I feel like it's been bought, and I do n't know. I just, if you're taking him back, can you take my memories of him too?'' I realize I am shaking now. 
 
 `` Alright love, I'm going to stop you right there,'' he says. He glances at his wristwatch. He sighs and sits back down on the toilet. `` Listen I did n't buy it alright? Your soul. You've had it all along. You were just so desperate and sad when I saw you at that marketplace and I wanted to make you feel better. So I told you I did. But I did n't, alright? Do n't take this the wrong way, but your request was too... vanilla. Too pure. Not greedy enough. Not convoluted enough. It just... was n't up to my standard. But I did n't want to hurt your feelings. So I lied, okay? Oh, and the avocado was stolen from your lunchbag. For dramatic flair. You had like, five in there.'' 
 
 `` But Greg-'' 
 
 `` I made you believe you'd meet the love of your life soon. That Placebo effect pseudo science whatnot. Gave you the courage to ask him out. I did n't do shit. That was all you guys.'' 
 
 The cat starts to stir. The devil widens his eyes. `` *Aaaaand* that's my cue,'' he says. `` Good luck with the mister. Say yes to the dress. Your marriage is going to be a breeze compared to looking after this one.'' He gestures wildly at the cat and is gone in nothing more than a puff. 
 
 Gently cradling the cat in my arms, I unlock the bathroom door. I am officially an hour late for work. I will deal with calling in sick later. But right now, I need to think up a story on how a lost kitty found its way into our yard to tell my future husband.

There was a time before her, though it's a time so heavily filtered by the years that I ca n't recall the events in any proper order, much less what life felt like before now. At some point there was a dog, I believe, and at another there was a hamster. A period of time between the ages of five and eight included... something of importance to me then, I'm certain. 
 
 To say that my memory is poor is inaccurate. I've simply chosen to ignore the past in favor of a more comfortable present.

 `` Being human is strange.'' 
 
 I sent the message through my telepathic feed to the mothership high above the atmosphere. They replied instantaneously. 
 
 `` Please continue the routine of the human male.'' 
 
 I sighed and went back into the rest chamber. Checking the still-buzzing buzz machine for the time, I realized I had to go to the Human Labor Camp very soon, so I had better cover myself in material. 
 
 The mothership told me that the materials were in something the humans referred to as a'clozzit'. I had no idea what a'clozzit' looked like, but there seemed to be a big box in the corner of the room with two swingydingers on the front, so I thought it'd be best to check there. 
 
 As usual, I was correct. There were different materials in here - some with even more materials somehow fused to a main material. I was confused. How did a human dress for Labor Camp? 
 
 After thinking for an extremely long time ( 2 and a half seconds ), I decided on a white material with plastic discs on the front, which seemed to slip into strange holes on the material in random places. I then chose an extremely small and tight cow-skin thing with two holes in that fit perfectly over my bottom limbs, and a black strip of fabric which I tied around the tibia in a very tight knot. 
 
 `` I look ridiculous,'' I thought to myself. `` Humans are strange.'' 
 
 With that, I exited the human's den and made my way to Labor Camp.

111398,"[ WP ] The Dyson sphere you and your crew have discovered contains something horrifying , something that is n't a star .
","There had been no reason to ever enter the system. 
 As far as star charts were concerned, it *wasn't* a star system - just another empty stretch of cold space. Out of any major freight lines and nowhere near major planets of any note, it lay undiscovered for hundreds of years. 
 If any of the few ships' passengers who passed within lightyears had bothered to look out the view ports in the direction on the sphere, they might have seen a brief dimming of the surrounding stars, then nothing. Those few who *did* catch it during long-haul flights put it down to a rogue asteroid or lack of sleep. 
 And so the sphere sat, cold and dark, emitting not even a shred of electromagnetic radiation. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 Anja laughed; this was the sort of situation they wrote about in old space dramas. Ambushed by syndicate pirates and their main computer down, only the hyperdrive was still active. VEM thrusters were shot and atmosphere was venting through a breach in the hull of her freighter. 
 `` What do we do?'' asked her pale first officer, his smartconsole awash with red symbols - too many for his rudimentary training implant to deal with. 
 `` Blind jump,'' Anja said; `` pick a direction, guess a number of light years and punch it in.'' 
 `` We could end up inside a star!'' 
 Another screed of red icons showed up as a second hull breach opened. 
 `` We could end up frozen corpses in space too.'' 
 With a nod, the young man fed in some number and activated the hyperdrive. 
 For a moment the sound of proximity alarms continued to blare, then abruptly they cut out as the cold grey void of hypserspace enveloped them. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 The jump ended three hours later, having taken them roughly in the direction of the galactic core - away from the core worlds and the last direction the pirates would have expected. 
 During the jump, Anja ordered her crew of fifteen to do as much patching and salvaging as they could; sealing off the breaches and getting the main computer back online. The basic functions were up and running again; navigation being the most important - once they came out of the jump they needed to take a fix and find out where they were. 
 The grey void dropped away and the freighter *Damocles* entered normal space with the collective crew holding their breaths. 
 Only darkness greeted them. 
 *Total* darkness. 
 `` Edmonds,'' the captain called to her notional science officer - who mostly dealt with dangerous cargo - `` where are the stars?'' 
 `` They're around us, the rear and side cameras show normal space. Directly ahead is some kind of, uh, *object*.'' 
 Anja tapped at her smart console, reading the data flowing in. 
 `` Fucking *hell*, how big is it?'' 
 `` About one point five AU.'' 
 The first officer, Michaels, had paled and was shaking his head, 
 `` No, that's not possible.'' 
 Swiping his console away, Edmonds brought up an image of the object from the various scans he'd run on it. 
 `` Looks like a Dyson Sphere.'' 
 
 & nbsp; 
 The ship had landed on the outer surface of the sphere to facilitate further repairs. The massive gravity of the object meant that it cost more fuel to keep away from it than to land on it. The navigation computer put them three hundred lightyears off course - no major obstacle - but they'd want to be in better shape before they jumped again - the exposed sections of ship had hyperfry; long term exposure to hyperspace without proper shielding made everything age unnaturally, becoming brittle and fragile. 
 `` It's going to take at least four days of solid work to remove shielding from non-critical areas,'' the ship's engineer growled down the comm channel to Anja, `` without even factoring in the damage from existing hyperfry.'' 
 `` Roger that Kasha, keep me apprised of your progress.'' 
 Edmonds looked at the captain eagerly. 
 She made a face at him,

","`` Look, I just wanted my fries. If you're not buying, could you please move aside?'' 
 
 I leisurely walked to the counter, ignoring the Pyromancer and Electromaster armed with railguns. Seriously, who robs a Micky's? 
 
 `` Hey sweetie, five of the unsalted ones, office's salty enough as is.'' the girl behind the counter did n't laugh, her tension after facing attempted robbery might be the cause. 
 
 `` Who do you think you are, you punk!'' the Pyromancer threw a fireball my way, which simply disappeared midway. 
 
 `` While you're here, wan na hear some story?'' I talked to the girl, still dumbstruck. `` What is the first ranked Killsprite ability?'' 
 
 `` No way, the Decomposer?!'' the Electromaster -- a girl, really, mus n't older than 18. She aimed her railgun -- and charged electricity through the weapon with her ability. A metal slug raced forward with triple the speed of sound. 
 
 `` I'm not asking you, brat.'' much to her surprise, the metal slug dispersed as harmless dust right before it touched me. 
 
 `` The first ranked Killsprite ability is called *'Dispersion'*, and by default, his ability is set to Disperse All Potentially Dangerous Object. By the way...'' I turned my sight to the Electromaster girl. `` the name is *Composer*, little girl.'' I mercilessly dissolved her consciousness -- in reality all I have done is just like jamming her mind, usually an Electromaster would be resistant to ability concerning minds, but it was only limited to ability related to altering the electric signal in her brain. 
 
 My *Dispersion* worked against the concept of'mind' itself, so even an Electromaster ca n't resist me. 
 
 `` So, are you buying or what?'' I turned towards the Pyromancer as I took my fries. The poor guy just ran towards the exit. 
 
 My name is Composer, a Killsprite -- that is, an instance of anomalous human being gifted ( cursed? ) with power to distort reality itself. My power was called'Dispersion', ability to decompose and destroy anything, be it physical object, quantum structure, energy, or an esoteric concept. I have no power other than to destroy. 
 
 And still, I have no desire to destroy anything. I was content enough to be an accountant in not particularly large corporation, as long as it enables me to buy tons of french fries daily. 
 
 But no one shall get between me and my daily dose of french fries. 
 
 The robbers were lucky enough that they were so weak I did n't have to go on a rampage to get them out of the way, but if they're stronger Killsprites, I might kill them -- destroy them to molecular level. If I have to, I would save the world from calamities or supervillains, just to preserve the pinnacle of human cuisine called french fries. 
 
 `` So.. it's all just for fries?'' a woman approached me as I munched through my third bag of french fries, I recognized her as one of the customers at the Micky's. 
 
 `` Got problem with that?'' I was leaning towards the railing of a large bridge. 
 
 `` No, nothing. It was just fascinating how the great Killsprite Composer was controlled by a simple dish called french fries.'' I do n't like to be interrupted in my fries-gobbling ritual. 
 
 `` Tell me what you want or I'll use my ability at both your mind and your clothes and then throw you down the river.'' the river below this bridge was n't particularly deep, nor its current particularly strong, but it was littered with huge rocks here and there. 
 
 `` Whoaa, scary, but you're big softie inside, right~'' 
 
 I dispersed the right sleeve of her business suit as a warning. `` Tell me what you want, woman.'' she grins. 
 
 `` I'm here to recruit you. There's a war coming, Composer. A war that put the existence of Killsprites as entirety at stake.'' 
 
 `` Not interested.'' I emptied my third bag and brought the other two away from the woman. `` I'll do my best to preserve french fries, but I wo n't give a damn about your war. I have enough power to crush either side on my own, after all.'' 
 
 `` Wait!'' the woman started following me, and I dispersed her other sleeve. 
 
 `` Do n't follow me.''

","It was n't chaos when everyone realized the problem, it was more, general confusion. We first got a call of a nervous neighbor that heard shots from the apartment across from her. We get there and see a twenty-something-year-old sobbing in the corner. He tried to shoot himself two times until he realized what was going on. 
 
 A few minutes later it was on the global news. People all over the world tried jumping off roofs, cutting themselfs, and nothing happened. No pain, no injuries, I tried it myself, drilling straight into my hand, I felt nothing. Adrenaline junkies rushed to the grand canyon, the top of the Burj Khalifa and even walked underwater to the bottom of the ocean. 
 
 After the UN gathered and tried to decide on a course of action, but no one was really worried, until all the news channels displayed four words. 
 
 -Prepare for six o'clock- 
 
 No one knows what happened, but people started to panic. Three hours until what, until this invincibility is gone, or until we die. I called my family, I had no idea what was to become of me, it was the only thing I could do. Thirty minutes until six I locked myself in my house, hoping that the anarchy of invincible, panicked humans in the streets would not get me. I watched the time, and as six o'clock rolled around I felt it. 
 
 My muscles ached, my bones felt like constant pressure was exerted on them. Any light I saw burned my eyes and I quickly shut off any lights I have and sat in the darkness. I sat on the floor and my intestines compressed within my own body. I felt as if I was ten times weaker than I had ever been. That's when I got the first call. I looked at the clock on my phone and it said 8 o'clock. I put the phone on the lowest brightness and see who called me. It was work. I was supposed to help everyone else in my town who I assume is suffering from the same thing as me. I could not come out, it was too painful. I turned off my phone and went to sleep. 
 
 When I woke up, I felt as if I had just come out of the worst hangover imaginable. I turn on my phone and look around at the messages I got during the what I assume was a night. Fifteen messages, all from work. I open the blinds in my living room and see the horror outside. Thousands of bones lie on the ground, the skin and muscle burned off. Then the smell hit me, burning skin and hair all meshed into one grueling combination. 
 
 I do n't remember the rest, except for the new message on the television. 
 
 -It will happen again- 
 
 I was one of the few lucky ones to survive the first wave so I have to share my message with the world. Stay indoors, use your invisibility to have fun, but for thirty minutes before 6 stay indoors. I know the internet might not work the best on the account of everyone being dead, but I heed my warning. I tried chopping my hand off today, and I did not work. It will happen again, prepare for it, please.

","I, Hrothgar the Magnificent, rise afore the burning sun. As I stretch, I let out a ferocious roar that resounds in my dark cave like a battle conch. Today is another glorious day of raiding and pillaging, and I must be off before dawn breaks. I pick the remains of last night's resplendent feast from my chestfur and soak myself before I mount my steed and ride into the brilliant morning. 
 
 Heroically I fly past the other raiders and pillagers, far inferior to mine own self, their steeds thinner and boxier. If ever a toll collector call me to pause, I politely indulge him with my shillings and immediately be off again. But the collectors... my patience with my enemies in battle is far greater than my patience with these. 
 
 I arrive and dismount. It is quite a trek, morning after morning, from my steed to the station of my murderous plunder, but this is how I build my strong legs. The legs of Hrothgar are like trunks of great oaks... like the pillars that hold the heavens afloat! I run into the fray, crying for the heads of my new vassals! 
 
 But before I can pillage even one of my vassals, Todd approaches. 
 
 `` Well, good morning there, H. Uh, hell of a yell you had this morning... was that like a battle yell? That was you right? Yeah... well. How was the commute?'' 
 
 I huff. 
 
 `` Good. Cool. Just wanted to make sure... you made sure and punched in this morning right?'' 
 
 Again. I huff. 
 
 `` A little more gently today than yesterday?'' 
 
 The ire I hold for my enemies in battle, and toll collectors, and all of the evil and weakness in the world... they are like little harmless bugs compared to my will to crush Todd. Todd is a little bird: he is brittle, he never stops chirping. His freckly bird-like head could be crushed in my palm. 
 
 `` It could have been anyone... it was a mistake. When I told you to punch in... well, I'll try to be a little more literal next time. But hey, at least you know never to do it again. And do n't worry: I still have n't said a thing to Andrea about it.'' 
 
 `` Said a thing about what?'' Her voice makes me simmer like a boiling couldron. 
 
 This is Andrea. Her tunic is wide and black like a billow of smoke... but her eyes give me fire in my loins and winter in my chest. She looks at Todd, and then she looks at me. 
 
 `` Well,'' Todd speaks. `` Ol' Hroth here may or may not have been the perpetrator in the time-clock incident the other day.'' 
 
 I adjust the nape of my suit of armor. Andrea gazes outward at nothing for a long while. Her lips draw tight. `` I'll let you off the hook this time, H.,'' she says. `` You're a good agent, after all.'' 
 
 I huff. I look at the ground. 
 
 `` Just do n't let it happen again. Now get to work.'' 
 
 I huff a huff of thanks and mount my throne. The bell on my table rings... it is like the sound of a swine squealing in pain as I tear its spine asunder. The time has finally come. 
 
 `` Hello, this is Hrothgar.'' 
 
 `` Yes, hello, this is Justin Mathews. My claim number is 708967-J. My car was totaled last week... it was broadsided but my claim was denied because... because apparently, like technically, the car was impacted on the front left `` shoulder,'' so not the side. Not technically. Which I guess means I'm not covered? But this simply ca n't be correct. I was broadsided in the middle of an intersection... this has to be some sort of mistake.''

","Hey mom, 
 
 Just writing to check in. Things have been going amazingly! 
 
 That clerical error at work that I was so worried about? Well, turns out a closer inspection by my manager's manager revealed that my boss had been systematically bilking the company out of thousands of dollars a year. They're promoting me into his position. I'll start next Monday. 
 
 And I know I told you about hitting that girl on my bike a few weeks ago. Her name is Amy. I felt so bad about hitting her that I begged her to let me make it up to her. We had our first date the next evening. Mom, I think she's the one. She's gorgeous, brilliant, funny, kind, and she loves me as much as I love her. I think you'll love her as much as I do. I ca n't wait for you to meet her. 
 
 I'm starting to feel unstoppable, like I can do no wrong. It's weird and hard to describe, but have you ever felt... I do n't know, have you ever felt like maybe you were blessed. Like you were the luckiest person alive, and that even the stars would move for you? 
 
 I think about all the things that have happened to me in my life, even the bad things, and how they always turn out for the best. Dad dying sucked, but the settlement ended up allowing you to retire without worries, and it allowed me to go to college debt free. Remember the time I lost my wallet and it came back to me in the mail the next week with $ 5000 in it and a letter explaining how the guy who found it had used the money I had inside it to buy groceries and a lotto ticket... and then won? I mean, come on. 
 
 Or, how about the week I had the flu during my last year at University? It was right before finals, I was totally out of it and unable to study. I was pretty sure I was screwed, but then all the finals ended up being multiple choice. I just filled in random bubbles and got `` A's'' on every single one. I do n't think I ever admitted that to you before, but is that even possible? All of them? 
 
 And it's not just the big things. Little things too. My flight getting overbooked so I had to wait, but then the next flight ended up missing a weather system that grounded the first flight short of its destination, so I actually arrived ahead of them. Falling down my stairs when the elevator was out and not even getting a bruise. Tripping over a crack in the sidewalk at an intersection right before a bus blew through the red light. 
 
 It's not just me. Other people notice it as well. They call me `` Lucky Larry'' at work. They made me order lunch from the 30-minutes-or-less deli as soon as they started to put it together that every time I ordered the lunch it ended up being free. Every time. 
 
 I could keep going, but it's just more of them same. 
 
 I've started testing it, my luck that is. I spent an hour one afternoon trying to throw a wadded up $ 20 out of my apartment window. The wind blew it back inside every single time. I switched to a window on the other side and the wind switched with me. Threw it out the window, back in it blew. 
 
 I'm not complaining. It's just starting to feel a little surreal. I feel, most days, like I am literally the luckiest man in the world. My life is amazing because of it. I wish I could share my luck with everyone in the world. 
 
 After I send this email on I'm going to go up to the roof of my building and jump off, and I already know that I'll somehow either blow back up on the roof, or land without a scratch. 
 
 Alright, mom. I'll talk to you soon. Ca n't wait for you to come visit next week and meet Amy. You'll love her. You'll see.: ) 
 
 Love you mom,

 I saw Randy first, and we hugged tightly as the tears flowed. His youth had been restored to him, and the spring was back in his step. I too had been rejuvenated, and I suddenly felt lighter than a feather, with the arthritis, rickety joints and decrepit bones all taken away. 
 
 “ Randy Tellerson? Is that you? ” 
 
 He turned, and for a moment confusion ruled his face. Perhaps the Randy back on earth would never have made the connection, what with the frailties of an aged mind, but here, here Randy pulled through. 
 
 “ Emma? Oh my goodness, Emma, it ’ s really you, ” he stuttered. Randy turned to me, gestured, and said, “ Emma, I want you to meet the woman I married after you passed, this is Sara. ” 
 
 Randy had almost never spoken of her. I had pressed, of course, whenever we came across a picture of her, or old documents with her name floated up, but he had frequently instead fallen back on his common refrain of “ what ’ s past is past ”, wearing that inscrutable smile of his. 
 
 She was far prettier than I had expected. There was a radiant sharpness to her features, a certain mischief twinkling in her eyes which lent an air of mystery to her. So this was Emma, the Emma who had shaped Randy to become the person he was. 
 
 “ So you ’ re the thing he settled for, it seems? ” she said, chuckling as we shook hands. “ I suppose you ’ re the best he could get after me, am I right? ” 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry? ” I said, even as I noticed Randy grow quiet, turning his gaze away, holding his tongue. 
 
 “ Oh come on, there ’ s nothing wrong with speaking your mind here, judgment has already been passed! So tell me, did he also swear to you that he would work harder, earn more money, give you a better life too? Is that why you married him? ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t… think that is… ” 
 
 Emma laughed, shrilly, and curious eyes turned to watch us. “ Well, that ’ s how he got me! Just promises and plans which never materialized! Did you know, in the ten years we were married, not once did we get to travel out of the country? Not once did we ever buy a new car? I died wearing the same ring passed down in his family for decades, and not the solitaire he said he would get me! ” 
 
 The smile had frozen on my face – I was beginning to understand. 
 
 “ I waited by his side for all that time, even though everyone told me to leave! Bah, wasted youth! It ’ s just my own bad luck then, wouldn ’ t you say, that I chose to spend my life with someone like him? In a way, I ’ m glad I died young, it meant that I could get here sooner, spend my existence amongst people who are better worth my time. ” 
 
 She turned to Randy again, and this time, her beauty had taken on a crystalline, icy edge. The arresting glint to her eyes were hard, cruel, unforgiving, and the elegance I admired just moments ago seemed tainted with an insatiable spite. 
 
 “ See you around never, Randy, and whatever your name is. ” 
 
 Emma strode off into the crowd, already waving to other friends she had made on this plane of existence. 
 
 Randy gripped my hand tightly. “ I ’ m sorry you had to hear all that… I wish I had provided better for her, got her the medical treatment she needed then. I hope… you were not as unhappy as she was. ” 
 
 I hugged Randy again, and this time I really pulled him in close, gripped him as tightly as I could, till I could hardly breathe myself. 
 
 I thought of our three children back on earth, who had all grown up strong, wise and kind, under Randy ’ s firm and judicious guidance. 
 
 I thought too of our modest but proud home, a little apartment in a less than stellar neighbourhood, but which had been the source of overwhelming warmth, laughter, and love, for the entirety of the forty years I spent with Randy. 
 
 I also thought of how we had both passed on together, he first because he was slightly older, and how he had told me just before he closed his eyes for the last time then that he hoped he had given me everything I wanted in life. I was too weak myself then to say so, but the answer was yes, always, always yes. 
 
 “ Don ’ t be silly, ” I said, nuzzling against his ear. “ We have each other now. Everything else… what ’ s past, is past. ”

 The high priced call girls I'd had sent to my hotel room were staring at my latest painting and beaming with smiles that made them look naive and idiotic. It was a painting of stick figures. Clearing my throat I growled `` I did n't bring you here to admire my work. Get over her and give me some lovin.'' 
 
 Gina ( or whatever the hell her real name was ) smiled at me. `` Sure thing Alan. It'll be some real lovin' too. I love your work, and... I think I kinda love you too.'' 
 
 Two hours later, the door closed behind her and Holly. I lay back on the bed, feeling sweaty, spent and miserable. I took a sip of whiskey and started crying. 
 
 In the morning I looked at the contract again. It was always to hand, no matter where I set it down. Part of the magic. The big man downstairs made sure that his clients could never lose their paperwork. I could leave in a gutter then be taking a shower, reach out my hand, and there it'd be. If I dropped it into the bath tub and pissed on it... who am I kidding with that `` if''. I'd done it a dozen times, and it was never worse for the wear. 
 
 As I skimmed through it, I noticed how the word `` artwork'' kept getting used so much that it started to lose it's meaning. There's a technical term for that, which I can never remember. When a word just becomes letters on a page, or a funny sound that your brain ca n't process anymore. That's what my art was to me these day. Nonsense... that's what I'd sold my soul for. Nonsense. 
 
 The implication of that were starting to seep into my mind. Sold my soul. That meant I was going to hell when I died someday. I'd be tortured, and hurt and abused for the rest of eternity, and it was for this hollow nothingness that I already hated. I thought of my ex-wife, who'd been trying to get back on good terms with me since my work started selling. She'd even allowed visits with the kids once I'd paid off the back debt on child support. Thinking of Erin and Aaron brought me down again. If I was lucky, once I died I've never see them again. They'd be up in heaven... but what if they were n't. Suddenly I wanted nothing more than to make sure that they never ended up where I'd be going. If only there was some way to guarantee... 
 
 I looked at the contract again. `` Artwork''! It said artwork, not paintings! Artwork is a pretty broad term, it can mean paintings, it can mean music, it can mean literature, it can mean movies... no mater what I made, people ate it up. They thought it was genius. Maybe I could use that to do some good.

 50 years later, I was standing on stage accepting my 21st Oscar. It was for a movie called `` Benny Takes A Bump'' about some kid who find religious salvation by quitting drugs, coming out of the closet and telling his parents that he's gay. I'd made the same sort of movies at least two times before, but this one had a much better cast than the other ones. 
 
 It was funny, because one of the other nominees for Best Director I'd beaten was me. I'd set a record by being the first director to get multiple nominations in Best Picture and Best Director three years in a row. This year also brought my total count to 61 nominations, which meant I'd finally beat one of Walt Disney's record. Two more wins, and I'd beat his other record for most wins. 
 
 As I left the stage, my chest started to hurt. My arm started feeling like it was on fire, and I stumbled down the steps. Marissa came rushing to my side, with Aaron and Erin following behind her. I was so glad I'd decided to take her back. I do n't know why, or how, but she'd been the one person that had been able to see through my work. She'd told me one night shortly after we'd started seeing each other again, that she thought a lot of it was garbage, but she was happy for me anyway. Having someone who could be honest with me had made a big difference. When she started telling me that my movies were getting better, it actually meant something. 
 
 All those movies, and only a few of them had impressed her as truly great. The crowds had loved em though. Tales of damnation and redemption that spelled out a message of Christian love and acceptance, or Jewish love and acceptance, or Islamic love and acceptance, or buddhist love and acceptance etc. I'd been credited by multiple people with starting a religious revolution. When the Dali Lama and Pope Mary II had jointly presented me with the Nobel Prize for Literature, the look of baffled pride on Marissa's face had been so beautiful. 
 
 As I hit the floor, she leaned down and took my hand. I smiled at her. `` It's okay luv.. I'll be...'' everything faded to black. I heard muffled gasps and shouts. Awhile later I heard some sobbing and talking. It took me awhile to recognize the voice. It was Aaron ``... know we never talked about this, but I really do n't think Dad would want to linger on like this. He's not gon na come out of this, the doctor was firm about that. He's had a good run and... Erin... am I making sense?'' 
 
 I could hear my daughter sniff back some tears. `` Yes... Mom... you know we have to do this, right?'' 
 
 I felt warm lips brush my forehead. `` Goodbye you sweet, goofy, magnificent bastard. We'll have to dance another time.'' It was the first thing she'd ever said to me, when I'd hit on her at the campus party over 6 decades ago. Her phone had made a chirp noise and she'd looked at a text right after I'd walked over to her and asked her to dance. She'd tracked me down between classes the following week and told me that her mom had sent her a message about her uncle being in a car wreck. She'd felt bad about saying something that she was sure I'd have taken as an insult. She'd somehow forgotten that she'd said `` we'll have to dance another time'' and only remembered calling me a sweet, goofy, magnificent bastard. 
 
 The sounds and sensations started to slip away. Then my eyes opened and the room was awash in red light. Sitting a chair next to my bed was the old man. 
 
 `` Well played kid. You really put in some effort there.'' 
 
 I smiled. `` Some effort you say? I think I did a fair bit've damage to you and yours.'' 
 
 He chuckled. `` If you really think that, it's only because you're an ignorant putz. You done me the biggest favor anyone ever did.'' 
 
 My smile froze. `` How's that?'' 
 
 `` Kid, because'a you, peace, love and understanding have spread farther and wider than at any other point in the history of the whole freaking world! Do you realize how big a deal that is? This is huge, a game changer!'' 
 
 `` How is peace love and understanding good for your side though?'' 
 
 `` Because it helps me spread the most important thing I'm named after.'' 
 
 `` Huh?'' 
 
 `` Do you know what Lucifer translates to in English?'' 
 
 `` No... um.. The Light Bringer or something like that?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, as in bringing the air of enlightenment. Spreading knowledge. The biggest impediment to enlightenment is and has always been war, and the god thereof, who you've so helpfully neutered.'' 
 
 `` Wait... god thereof? What?!'' 
 
 `` War Kid, the God of War? He of the Ark of the Covenant? Y'know, Yahweh?'' 
 
 I looked at him agog. `` You're saying Yahweh's the god of war?'' 
 
 `` Yeah! Have you not read his rather famous book? The one that includes stuff like him ordering the murder of thousands of people at a time? The one where he gives his followers permission to take sex slaves after they've killed men and boys in rival cities. Yahweh was a war god who went rogue and took out most of the rest of his pantheon. I'm one of the few to survive, and think about it for a minute. Can you imagine any other kind of god that would be a bigger threat to a War God?'' 
 
 My mind went numb. `` But... does that mean... my wife... my kids!'' 
 
 `` Do n't worry Alan. They're not going to Yahweh's heaven. Most people do n't these days. They're headed to Jesus's heaven. It's a much nicer place. Wan na go take a look?'' 
 
 `` WHAT!''

189968,"[ WP ] Your whole family is sitting by your grandfather 's deathbed while he asks only you to lean closer . He whispers in your ear , `` I never trusted your father , but I can see it in you . '' Before pushing a ring with a strange gem into your hand and then flatlining .
","`` I never trusted your father, but I can see it in you.'' my grandfather whispered, handing me his ring. His hands were frail, feeble-like that of a child. I was about to ask him what he meant by that but then, I heard a sound, almost like a sigh... and then... 
 
 A trailing beep... and it was over. We all cried, said our tearful goodbyes, and that was that. 
 
 Except not really, of course. It was really just the start of it all. 
 *** 
 Back in our two-story house, I examined the ring. Even in the dead of night, the red jewel embedded in the ring shone bright, sending dazzling red beams onto the walls of my room. 
 
 The first thing that I had been struck by when I had first looked at the ring was the strange jewel that was embedded in it. A cursory search of the internet seemed to classify it as red diamond-a type of diamond that was incredibly rare and mysterious in nature, especially in regards to it's creation. It's believed to be the result of stress as it comes up from to the surface, which distorts the lattice structure and traps electrons in such a way that it reflects red light-though it was n't known for certain if that was the case. 
 
 I ca n't claim to understand any of that-honestly, I'm not one for the sciences, and do poorly in every single one I took but physics ( I'm somewhat known as being something of a math whiz among my friends ). Still it was interesting, learning about the diamond's colour... yet it does n't explain why grandfather did n't want me to tell my dad about it... 
 
 Just then, I heard voices coming from my fathers room... one was definitely my father. But the other... the other sounded different. **Alien**, in a way. I got out of my room, and approached the door to listen in on the conversation. 
 *** 
 `` **You incompetent fool! **'' the alien voice hissed, `` **How could you have missed it? That artifact was vital to us! Acquiring it would have rolled back resistance in your sector massively! Now who knows where it could be! **'' 
 
 `` Yes, I know,'' my father replied. He sounded aggravated. I knew he had n't been sleeping well, but this sounded beyond even that... `` But you know that the ring can not be taken from someone unwillingly! I was waiting till the old man died, but the ring was already gone!'' 
 
 `` **Most troublesome. **'' the alien voice spoke, `` **Do you know who could have taken it? Or is this beyond your scope as well? **'' 
 
 `` No. There is only one candidate who could have taken it before he died. My daughter. I'll simply ask her to give it to me. She ca n't possibly know of the Red Thunder's abilities or significance, so she'll likely give it to me without a second thought.'' 
 
 `` **And if she refuses? You failed to kill your father due to your sentimentality for the old fool. Will this be another repeat? The plan moved forwards, even if you stood still, and I can not tolerate that again. **'' the other voice said, a harsh, sinister tone creeping into it's words. I shivered. I did n't like where this voice was starting to go. 
 
 `` No. This time, I can do it. I wo n't fail you. The Red Thunder is as good as ours, and resistance in my sector shall be finished. Trust me. If it comes to that... my daughter will be dealt with.'' 
 
 I gasped. Was he saying what I think he was? 
 
 Too late, I realized that I had made a **very** audible noise. The silence that followed it was almost deafening. Hurriedly, I retreated back to my room. 
 
 I did not have to wait long before he stormed in. 
 
 `` How much of that did you hear?'' He demanded to know, anger in his voice. 
 
 I shied away from him, voice quavering as I asked `` What do you want with this-this ring?! Why do you want it bad enough to kill me?'' 
 
 A range of emotions passed over his face. Shock, fear, anger, sadness... but in the end, the only one that remained was cold acceptance. `` So be it,'' he muttered, and suddenly, in a flash, a green wrist mounted knife appeared from a peridot gem he kept on his right arm. 
 
 `` Wait, you were serious?!'' I squeaked out as he darted towards me, knife positioned for a quick and silent kill with a straight shot towards my heart. Not wanting to watch, I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping against hope that he was n't serious, that he would n't kill me... 
 
 And then, suddenly, I heard a BANG!, like a thunderbolt had just materialized. Then, a groan. Curious, and noting the lack of pain between my ribs, I cautiously opened my eyes. 
 
 I opened them just in time to catch faint bolts of red lightning dancing over the diamond in my ring, which seemed to be the cause of my fathers current location on the ground, nursing a wounded shoulder. Fearfully, I froze, knees quivering. Then he stared at me, hatred in his eyes, and his bejeweled knife emerging back out from it's gem. 
 
 I booked it out of there, flew down the stairs, and ran out the door. I ran for so long I thought my lungs would burst. 
 
 Only later did I realize how stupid I'd been-I left my wallet in my room, and now had virtually no money that I needed to survive! As such... 
 
 Could I stay with you? I'd ask my other friends, but they all are so far away that I'd have to drive-and the car is back at my house, which is currently somewhere I do not want to be... 
 
 You will? Thank you so much... I guess I'll tell you more about what I've learned about the diamond and what I think is going on tomorrow morning. As it is, I'm so tired I do n't even care if I sleep standing up right now...

","The door opened with a creak that was familiar, but I could not recognize the woman standing on the other side. “ Um, So Sorry… I must have the wrong apartment ”, I offered, and stepped back to look at the door number. At the same time that I saw the brass 12 that indicated that this was indeed my house, the woman fell to her knees, sobbing. “ How could you do this to us? ”, I heard, between her sobs. The realization hit me, and I was filled with dread, even though all this still made no sense to me. “ Ir… Irene? ”, I stammered, and knelt beside her, opening her hands that were still covering her face. It was her, but.. But it was not. I backed away from her with a jerk. Then, I heard nothing. I could only see her features contort, a popping vein in her forehead, spit flying everywhere as she screamed. Irene did not look like this, she was much younger, but somehow I knew she was in front of me. 
 
 Suddenly, I saw a pair of arms on Irene ’ s shoulder, and looked up. There, leaning over her, was my daughter, but much older. I staggered back until I could manage to get on my feet, and just ran. My heart was beating faster than ever, and then everything went black. 
 
 When I woke up, I was in a bed, in my bed. “ What a wierd dream ”, I sighed, and walked out of the room. I saw her, and was struck by a familiar feeling of despair. “ After all this time… Why do you come here now? ”, she said, holding back tears. It took me a while to find my voice. “ Irene, I… What happened? I just went out and came back.. Why is everything so different? Why do you look so different? ” “ That ’ s what happens in ten years, asshole ”, she retorted back. ” You think I ’ m the one who looks different? You don ’ t look that great either ”. I touched my face, and it felt foreign. I ran to the mirror, and saw a different man, an old man. “ What happened? ”. Irene stood at the door, a puzzled look on her face. She launched into a tirade about how I was a horrible man, how I could leave them without a word, no indication. Eventually, I found it in me to respond. “ Irene, I don ’ t.. I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about. I just went out for a cigarette ten minutes ago. ”, I managed to stammer. Irene ’ s face softened immidiately. She took my arm and sat me on the bed. She hugged me and started weeping into my shoulder. 
 
 A few months have passed since the incident. It ’ s still quite puzzling. I ’ m still trying to figure out what happened, and why my wife removed all the calendars from the house.

","Hey /r/LucidDreaming, I had a cool experience with my dreams last night. 
 
 It was the first time I've ever had sleep paralysis, so I do n't have anything else to base it on, but it was really cool. The `` demon'' or whatever was scary, but he also talked to me. A classmate of mine died in September, by suicide, and I've really missed him. We were n't super close or anything, but he was the kind of guy that I wished I was better friends with. Anyway, he was the one I saw, all demoned-out with bat wings and claws, and he had red eyes just like these contact lenses that he wore to school every Halloween. 
 
 So `` Zach'' ( obviously not his real name, I do n't want you to know my real identity ) was there at the foot of my bed and he's staring at me, and I thought it was a false awakening for a minute until I realized I could n't move. I sometimes have problems speaking in dreams, but apparently not in SP. So I started talking to him, about how confused and angry I was about him killing himself. Zach just said `` Calubedy, it had nothing to do with you. You could n't help me, so stop feeling bad about it. It's not like I'm in hell or anything, that's not real. Just come by my grave on our birthday, okay?'' so I said yes, I would definitely do that, and maybe bring a beer. Neither of us are drinkers, so he got the joke. 
 
 TL; DR I saw a dead acquaintance during SP and he helped me get some closure after his suicide. True story.

260060,"[ WP ] Vampires have to drink the blood of a compatible donor for their blood type .
","One thing that surprised me about being a vampire was this: your stomach still makes noises. I had always figured that, yeah sure, the living dead drink blood, but I didn ’ t expect the organs to still somewhat function. I suppose something has to be done with all the blood though. 
 So when I sit down to pretend to donate blood, and my stomach growls, I get some concerned looks. One woman actually got up and spoke to a nurse. The nurse comes over, looking bored. She asks in an annoyed tone, “ Have you made sure to eat a satisfactory amount today? ” 
 “ Yes! ” I say quickly. I haven ’ t, but I ’ m working on it. It's awful only being able to go to the blood bank when it's dark out. The nurse grunts and walks away. 
 
 Suddenly, opportunity: the girl next to me gives me a concerned look again. I look over at her and roll my eyes. “ You ’ d think they ’ d want me to donate my O-positive, but they always give me so much hassle. ” 
 She blushes from my attention and squeaks, “ I ’ m type O-positive as well. ” 
 I grin. “ No kidding! Can I tell you a secret? ” 
 She nods, and I scoot closer. “ I haven ’ t had dinner yet. I did eat today though, I swear. ” She giggles, so I continue, “ What about you? Have you had dinner yet? ” 
 She shakes her head. “ I usually eat around 7 or 8. ” 
 “ We should finish around the same time. What do you say we grab dinner afterwards? ” 
 Her face continues to blush, and I can just imagine the taste of her blood. I hope I don ’ t drink too much. I don ’ t want to accidentally kill anyone again. 
 
 
 Thankfully, the girl is called in first. So while she ’ s getting her blood taken, I duck into a bathroom and wait it out. I time it so I come out just behind her, and thank the blood bank again for having separate donating rooms. 
 `` How ’ d it go? ” I ask. 
 “ Good! ” she says. “ You? ” 
 `` Also good. Let ’ s go get some dinner now! ” I suggest a place that I know has good soup, and we go there. That ’ s another secret of vampirism: we can still intake certain drinks and foods. Solid foods are incredibly painful to digest, and they take a few weeks though, so I avoid those. Soup is still a bit painful, but I can manage it. Interestingly, most people won ’ t comment on my just eating soup, possibly out of shyness. 
 
 After we leave the restaurant, I take her hand and lead her to a dark alley. She ’ s hesitant but follows. I push her up against the wall and begin to kiss her. Again, she hesitates, but gives in. I kiss her for a while, and then kiss her along her jaw and then down her neck. A kiss here, a kiss there, and then a bite. As I bite down, I cover her mouth with my hand so she can ’ t cry out. And I drink her metallic, sweet blood.

","Lydia's hand lingered on the handle. The heat had left her fingers, and they stood out pale against the tarnished brass knob that opened the way down to the cellar. She felt cold. 
 
 *'' It has been three months,'' *, she thought. The heater kicked on with a distant cough, and warm, dusty air began to stir around Lydia's ankles. It dissipated quickly in the drafty kitchen. She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other. She thought about the quilted comforter tossed back on her bed at that very moment. She thought about how it might still retain some of the heat she'd left behind. 
 
 Her hand fell to her side, but she did n't move away. Three months since she'd last been in the cellar. She was still trying hard to put it behind her. She still had vivid dreams about what had happened in the basement. *'' Just dreams,'' * she thought. She had resigned herself to the fact that she'd likely dream about it for the rest of her life. If she had learned anything, dreams were fine. Healthy even. It was what she did while she was awake, the things she had n't been able to remember, that haunted her. But it had been three months. 
 
 *'' No reason to go down into the cold basement and frighten myself over nothing. No reason to stay up like this when I have work in the morning. No reason to-'' * 
 
 Something shifted audibly in the basement - then again. Slow. Painful. There was a bang, followed by a low moan. Then - quiet, shuddering, laughter. The sound wavered off into wet bubbling, and Lydia watched with horror as her hand went numbly to the knob. The tendons pressed up beneath her bloodless flesh as she willed herself to turn away, to let go, to step back. This was n't right. The knob turned and the door swung open. 
 
 Everything Maria had told her was a lie. 
 
 Everything they had done, the last three months, the therapy, had been a deception. 
 
 It was n't over. 
 
 Trapped behind eyes that would n't shut, Lydia descended the stairs, and the laughter burbled up from the dark. Each step was like easing down into an autumn pond. The door behind her shut, and she was left floating in the void. 
 
 Every nerve seemed to vibrate as she strained for the warmth of her quilt, the feeling of the mattress beneath her. Just a dream. A vivid dream. She had had this dream countless times, but the cold had never felt this deep, this hungry. 
 
 A hand, fever warm and clammy, cupped Lydia's face. It burned in contrast to the cold that had swallowed her up. Lydia could smell something like ozone. 
 
 The whisper was a hot gust, the breath a chemical wind. Maria's voice betrayed her smile as she whispered into Lydia's ear. `` I was wondering when you'd wake up.''

 `` We saw them in the city, raiding our homes for supplies. We tried to fight back but they drove us out!'' He continued. `` Those monsters took most of the city!'' 
 
 We listened in stunned silence as he recounted the story of how his own family was killed, unable to choke back the emotion in his voice. We did our best to console him in the moment, but knew we all stand to lose more at the hands of those beasts. Our sadness turned to frustration and then anger. 
 
 In the Final War, we fought for an everlasting peace, and those monsters brought us to our knees. They gave us no mercy or respite, and in turn, we did the same. They were born killers, filled with anger. Always so angry. We were born out of that anger, and dreamt of becoming so much better than that as the war raged on. 
 
 As the losses on both sides piled up, we began to realize how pathetic this had become. We sent diplomats to negotiate a truce, but there was no end to their hostility. They made it clear the War would drag out until one of us was destroyed. We are lucky it was n't us. 
 
 We vowed to never let this happen again, and we scoured every last corner of the globe to exterminate every last one of them. Officially speaking, they've been extinct for years, and nobody around here has seen one in decades. We have forgotten war, and what it's like to lose someone you love. Our peace has been shattered. Our everlasting peace. 
 
 Someone took Mark away so he could rest, while we composed ourselves and got ready for a hunt. It had been so long that most of us forgot how to kill these monsters. 
 
 `` Just rip off their heads!'' Someone yelled. 
 
 Fair enough, I suppose. They do n't deserve anything more. We decided to send messengers to nearby communities to spread the word. In a couple weeks the whole world would learn of the outbreak. Unfortunately we will not wait to hear their reply. We need to contain this now. Nobody is sure how quickly they breed, but they seem to multiply so fast that once you have a sizeable infestation, they are almost impossible to remove. We organized a posse and marched throughout the night toward the city. 
 
 We found them in the morning, sleeping in an abandoned house. They shot at us as we forced open the doors. They have guns and other weapons, but we outnumber them many times over. We will make quick work of these beasts. We will find where they came from. We will find their caves and hiding places. We will have our peace once again.

 `` Y' got ta aks buhfore you take sumpthing.''

136854,"[ WP ] Write about the final moments of a leader 's life from a first person perspective .
","They were damn fools to follow me. 
 
 Mitch caught me looking at him and flashed a smile, one that a casual observer might have found careless, but I knew it hid fear. Lena tried to mask her own emotions, but was n't as good at it as the older man. She wore a face showing nothing, but her fingers tapped rhythmically on her wooden staff. Gray stared out at the opening of the cave, barely visible from our position, eyes calculating. 
 
 Damn fool, there was no escape. 
 
 I'd killed us. 
 
 We were surrounded. Backs to a cave wall and no where to run. Even the small spot of light from the entrance grew dark as men approached. 
 
 Even with Lena's magic, Gray's intelligence, and Mitch's strength, my leadership had brought us to death. 
 
 `` I'm sorry,'' I whispered. 
 
 The three turned to me. There was a moment of extended silence. 
 
 `` Sorry?'' Mitch's smile widened. `` We go everywhere together, brother, even into the afterlife.'' 
 
 `` For the last time,'' Gray replied, voice calm, `` there is no afterlife.'' 
 
 `` If it does exist,'' Lena breathed heavily and quickly after the energy she'd moved in our failed escape attempt, `` you're buying us all a round.'' 
 
 Gray laughed, a sound that had no place in our position. 
 
 `` Fine.'' The short man stepped back to Lena's position leaving me and Mitch ahead of them. `` But I'll let you guys go there first, being that I'm a gentleman.'' 
 
 Mitch laughed this time, deeper and louder then the previous. 
 
 `` Brother,'' The warrior put a hand on my shoulder. 
 
 I stared at Mitch, head bowed. `` Yeah?'' 
 
 `` You're the best man I'd ever known.'' Mitch spoke low. `` I've served more than my fair share of men, and the whole lot of them would n't come to half of what you are.'' 
 
 I did n't reply, instead looking again at the entrance, growing darker by the second. 
 
 `` Now,'' Mitch continued, `` let's kill as many of'em as we can.'' 
 
 I did n't deserve them. 
 
 I nodded and put on a smile. My sword fell free of its scabbard and I stepped forward. `` What was the original plan again?'' 
 
 Mitch laughed once more. `` Frontal assault!'' 
 
 Gray sighed, likely remembering the hundreds of reasons he'd suggested otherwise. 
 
 `` Well,'' I turned to Lena and Gray, `` plan B.'' 
 
 `` Frontal god damned assault!'' 
 
 Mitch's battle-cry roared through the cavern and echoed off the walls. I could see the outlined shapes of our enemies freeze. I gave my own cry, but it was lost in Gray's and Lena's own. 
 
 Like I said, I did n't deserve them.

 `` Right, Noted, I will stop asking that. But is it just me or are there a lot more people around now?'' Leon said, turning his head to scan their surroundings. A lot more gibberish people were gathered around the cube now, along with more `` normals''. 
 
 `` Indeed there are, although you would think they would stop sending people through after the first few.'' Siri answered `` I mean, we do n't even know who these people are, let alone what they are saying.'' 
 
 At that moment, a gibberish person rushed through the crowd and virtually tackled Siri, almost throwing her down to the ground. 
 
 `` You know her Siri?'' Leon asked cautiously, as the gibberish woman clutched her tighter. 
 
 Struggling to free herself from the gibberish person's embrace, Siri answered through clenched teeth `` No I do n't, and I would appreciate some help here.'' 
 
 After Leon broke them apart the gibberish woman just stared at Siri, tears filling up her eyes, before running back into the crowd spilling tears along the street. 
 
 `` Well that was wierd.'' Leon said `` You okay?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.'' Siri said `` I just need a minute.'' 
 
 He just silently put his arm around her and they stood there for a while, listening to the gibberish people speak the language they could never understand.

122100,"[ WP ] An experienced burglar mistakenly steals from his friends stash only to discover he was an undercover FBI Agent . Write about what happens next .
","It was another job, but not necessarily like any other. Slide into the open window, wear gloves, take only what you can get in 15 minutes, get the hell out. It should have been that simple, regardless of the situation. `` I never thought I'd end up taking from friends or family'' I thought to myself for at least the twentieth time. 
 Sneaking into Steve's house was easier than usual. Even though I had the key, I still had to use the window above the flowers to sneak in to avoid suspicion. It was unlocked, therefore the obvious choice. Hollywood likes to make robberies look like smash and grabs: bashing in windows, storming into houses, scaring the residents and tieing them up. Not the case. It's best when no one is home, just try a window; if one is n't open, you move along to a house where one is. Never too close to the previous one you tried, never too far from the vehicle. But again, today was different. Nobody would expect anything when my truck was parked in front of Steve's house, they've seen it a million times. 
 Living room was done, six minutes left. I slink into the bedroom feeling guilty. `` If Steve ever found out, he would kill me. No question about it.'' I had passed out drunk on the floor in the doorway to the bedroom, slept on his couch, and partied until the sun came up too many times to count in this house, so the layout was nearly painfully familiar. `` Just do what you need to, do n't nose, grab the pawn-worthy goods.'' Usually I would allow myself to dig through apparent personal effects for up to two minutes, not today. Even for a cat burglar like myself, this was... creepy. I stretched my arm under the bed, reaching for the shotgun and the AR-15 that I knew would be there. Hell, I'd put them there after our last shooting extravaganza out in the middle of nowhere five days ago. My hand instinctively reached for the front of the bed where I knew I'd last left them. My fingers grazed something, but it was too light. `` The gun would n't move like that'' I thought to myself, sweeping back a little further to pull it out. 
 `` Holy shit. Holy shit. HOLY SHIT.'' It was n't intelligent, but it was the best I could do given the current circumstance. My finger slid across the bronze badge in my hand, `` There's no way. How the hell could he be FBI?'' It was a valid attempt at hiding the badge and identification, tucked behind the bedpost near the nightstand, and only a circumstance as crazy as this one would have created a situation where anyone would find it. But here it was, in my hand. Badge and identification for The Federal Bureau of Investigations. `` Was he onto me? Was he even assigned to my case? We had been through so much, so many situations, was he REALLY FBI?'' These thoughts raced through my dizzying head. My watch beeped, allerting me that I was closing in on my pre-set time limit. I threw the badge into the bag with the iPad and laptop that I had grabbed from the room, and took off for the window. 
 `` WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'VE BEEN ROBBED?!'' Mike screamed at the uniformed officer. I've seen him in this state before, he was about to lose it. I was driving up to his house, and jumped out of my car as I slammed it into park. 
 `` Mike!'' I shouted, moving along at a fast run. `` Settle down, you know it's not his fault!'' 
 Mike rounded on me, with the officer looking slightly relieved, stepping back forward, and removing his hand from his tazer. `` Can you believe this? This GENIUS just told me again that I've been robbed!'' 
 I put my hand on his chest and started pushing him back under the tree in the front yard, mumbling something to the officer about giving us a moment. The cop nodded in my direction, and strolled back inside. 
 `` I'll kill whoever this was, man. I swear. I do n't know how they thought this was a good idea.'' he paced around me and the tree, fumbling for a cigarette from his pocket. `` This is bullshit. These idiots already told me they're probably not ever gon na catch the guy, it's probably part of a string of'serial robberies' that're going on in the area.'' He took a long drag from the cigarette. 
 I still had n't fully recovered from the blow that had been struck upon me just over two hours ago, and it took every ounce of my practice of 32 years of lying to keep a straight face and look him right in the eyes and say `` We'll find him, man. Just settle down right now. These assholes are n't gon na help, we'll find him.'' 
 There was a look in his eyes, it was hard to tell at that very moment if it was purely the rage, or if for a second he cracked and revealed just in a split moment that he was onto me. 
 Another long cigarette drag. `` Yea we will. I'm gon na make that douchebag wish he never lived.'' 
 It had been about three weeks since the night of the robbery, and it was strange helping Mike `` hunt'' for his robber. We cruised the streets after dark, talking to the neighborhood teenagers, shaking them up a bit, asking them what they knew and what they'd seen. I could n't help this whole time wondering how much of this Mike had picked up in the academy, and how much had just come natural from life in a mediocre city. `` Is he actually looking for someone else? Is this still an effort to locate me? Is this a wild goose chase, or does he know?'' 
 Mike was getting more rough, more distraught, cornering me once in a while, asking me `` How would you rob a house, man? If it were you, what would you do?'' I could n't tell if these were the ramblings of a furious man, or if he was trying to trap me. `` You do n't seem to be as into this as me. If it were you, heads would be rolling.'' he finally told me one night as we were walking home after a night of a few drinks. `` You know, I had to practically threaten you to get you to come out tonight. Ever since I got robbed, you're being kinda scarce. What gives?'' 
 Here it was. I had to keep some distance. I was avoiding him, I could n't help it. The combination of the guilt and the fear of what the hell he was doing with me when he was an agent. `` I'm sorry man, I've been busy'' was the best excuse I could come up with when my head was still fuzzy. 
 `` Do n't give me that shit. You know full well that I'd fuck somebody up if this happened to you. You're lying right to my face, and I know it'' his anger was fueled with booze right now, and it was legitimately scaring me. He was always good at reading people, and even though he was feeling the booze as much as me, I could tell he was reading me. `` You're not telling me something. Cut the shit, right now. You're gon na tell me, or I'm gon na beat it outta you!'' he was yelling now, and had pushed me up against a road sign. 
 `` Mike! Calm down man, it's not that big of a deal!'' 
 His face dropped. He pushed me harder into the sign, he was bigger than me by about 30 pounds. `` What the fuck do you know? I can see there's something you're holding out. I'm done with your excuses. What the fuck do you know?'' He had me in such a tight grip now, I could n't breathe. 
 `` Mike!'' I tried to squeak out, losing air fast. `` Mike, you got ta let me go!'' 
 `` I do n't. I think I got ta get some answers'' he threatened, now with his other arm around my throat. `` What the fuck is going on? How could you possibly be keeping something from me right now? It's ME we're talking about!'' 
 I started greying out of consiousness `` Mike... please... let go, I'll tell you what I know!'' I need to think fast...

","My eyes flickered open. This was strange. I do n't remember driving back to my childhood home last night. Plus I always thought I outgrew this bed long ago. 
 `` Sam, honey! You're gon na be late for school,'' my mom hollered from downstairs. Only she did n't sound as exhausted as she'd been for the last few years. Of course I'm gon na be late for school. I'm a seven hour drive away from my university so I'd never make it on time. 
 I stood up to go to the bathroom and immediately knew something was off. My ceiling had n't been this high. I stumbled my way to the bathroom and look in the mirror. There's no way. I'm my awkward preteen self again? I must be dreaming or nightmaring or whatever you could call this strange occurrence. I ran downstairs only to see my mom looking 10 years younger. Surprised, I dished out the compliment only to find my voice much higher than I'd hoped. 
 `` Well thanks Sam but compliments wo n't get you out of taking that life science test today!'' She said happily and kissed my on the head. The strangest pet was being shorter than her again. Wait. Life science. That means I'm in 7th grade. I wonder if it's happened yet. For now I guess I have to play along until I can go back to sleep and hopefully wake up in my own apartment ready to take on my last round of midterms. I grabbed a granola bar and the car keys before heading outside. Just as I was hopping in the car my mom came rushing out. 
 `` Sam! Oh my goodness what do you think you're doing, young lady?'' Oh right. I guess a 12 year old in Idaho should n't know how to drive herself to middle school. But then again there's a lot of things I should n't know. I should n't know how to code or derive equations or recall the linear analysis notes I took yesterday. I should n't know who wins the World Series for the next 10 years. Most importantly I should n't know where my dad is. I ponder whether or not I should tell my mom. I remember seeing the pain behind her smile everyday for nearly five years after she found out. I wonder if it would be easier coming from me. 
 As we pull up to Fremont Jr. High I look over to her. If I did have to be 12 again I'm happy I can spend some time with her before it all happens. This next year was one of the hardest of my childhood because I saw how much news of my fathers death had destroyed her and led her to unspeakable deeds to provide for us. Only this time is different because this time I can help. I can get a job sophomore year instead of wasting my time on a sport I wo n't end up playing in college anyway. I can get scholarships for academics. I can place bets on major sporting events. Oh my God. I can place bets on major sporting events. It's January 2006. I can tell by the calendar my mom always kept on the dashboard. No one knows the Steelers are gon na win the super bowl yet. But I do. I remember most outcomes from 2006-2009 because I had watched them hoping to feel as though my dad was beside me each time. My mom wo n't have to sell our cars or our house or her body to help put dinner on our table. This time I'll be able to provide enough so she only has to continue working her pet time job. This time it'll be different.

","John stopped for a moment as he reached the top of the clearing. Dripping with sweat and exhausted he sat down on the cold, dusty ground and put his back up against an old oak tree that provided him some shade from the sun. It was just another typical Saturday afternoon for John as he ran to keep himself fit and healthy for the future. John then felt a cool breeze drift across the clearing he was in as he began to relax himself even more, taking in the beauty of the scenery around him. The crystal blue sky, the emerald green trees, the black onyx mountains that littered the background all around him. John began to dose off as the breeze picked up and began to turn into a gust of wind that chilled him. Seeing nothing around him, John stood up and wondered what it could be. He then heard the beat of wings, a screeching noise of distress, and turned to see Jack shooting across the sky towards him. John signed as he saw the sight of Jack approaching from the distance. Jack was his guardian angel, a half-man half-bird divine creature that had been sent to make John's life as perfect as possible, in fact everything about John's life was going well thanks to Jack. John had a nice job, he was well-respected in the community, and his parents loved him. But that was 6 months ago. And John had begun to notice some particular things about the way that Jack acted towards him that seemed out of place. There was just something about the way Jack's hawk-like eyes would watch him as he went about his day, there was so sort of deep-longing within those eyes that John could n't explain. Lately he'd caught Jack watching him as he slept at night, claiming it was just to make sure he was safe and comfortable while he slept. John, at first, did n't take any note of it as his life was going too perfectly for another to be of any concern, but as the days and weeks go on, Jack began to move closer and closer to the bed with the same stare of longing deep within his eyes. John wondered if Jack ever slept at all with how much he watched over him, John assumed he did n't need to. John usually did n't run out this far into the countryside, but what Jack had done the night before had given him a bit of a fright. Jack was softly, tenderly and delicately moving his wing feathers over John's face, and John had awoke to his guardian angel above him. `` Just helping you sleep dear,'' is all John could get out of Jack. 
 
 Now Jack was racing toward John, and the screeching grew louder. What if he had n't caught Jack last night? What is something more had happened to him? John did n't think about it too much. He signaled to the priest that Jack had taken the bait. The priest nodded, and the nuns hiding in the bushes emerged. Wielding high-caliber rifles loaded with silver bullets they pierced through the angel's body and it fell to the ground, motionless. `` Devils do n't come from the ground beneath us, they come from the sky,'' the priest said as the nuns purified the ground and the body of the angel with holy fire. John's life had been saved.

14901,"[ MP ] Tell me the story of Brandy or The Sailor
","Brandy had noted various types of men the sea had brought her over the years. The typical boorish slag who came blustering into her bar was a generic, if amusing sight. The overconfident pretty-boys who strode in with boots clogging on her chipped hardwood floors were ever a fun target for mockery, but her favorite type, was the occasional level-headed one. One who had braved the seas, had lived amongst wave and maritime turmoil, and through brutal tribulation was molded into a swift engine of survival, who's wisdom was great and pleasure scant. 
 
 She had come to know all of these types in one way or another, mostly through vicarious amusement, yet for those of the third and greatest ilk true depth came into the relationship. Once, only once, did this depth plummet below the farthest fathoms of the sea she served on. It was a love she knew briefly, from a man she would never see again. 
 
 The night he came in was one that rained in such torrential fury each sailor, though accustomed to, and intimate with water, had been driven to the nearest building of shelter. Her bar served as just this for many. They clustered about her tables and rejoiced in her finely built fire and freshly poured ale. It was on this night that he came in, a tall Spaniard, with raven hair and blossoming stubble only setting the precedent for the rugged face that in an instant held Brandy's heart. 
 
 He came across the floor to an empty table, and set alone. Much she learned from his stride, the boldness and surety of his gait echoed many nights on the sea, where perhaps the ground was not so stable. After a spell she came over, and asked his fancied drink, and their eyes met briefly. In that glance a recognition occurred, as if they had known each other for a very long time. This connection assuaged and expected social barriers, friendship occurring instantly. She collected his order and promptly served it to him. 
 
 She lamented her menial serving duty, which was pulling her away from the object who so possessed her. Yet she took comfort in each wayward glace they shared, each brief smile, she knew that he would not leave her, not yet. After several more hours, the bar had closed, the whether abated, and the sailors departed. All but one. 
 
 That Summer was the first they spent together, being the last as well. For though they were lovers born for one another, Brandy could see it in his fashion and manner, her man, the Spaniard who had stolen her heart, was not to part with his greater lover, the sea. Each night they lye together, she felt the oncoming day of his departure like a wave, deep and black, pummeling towards the shore she lived for. She tried to run, yet inevitably it consumed her, rushing her joy and love for the world away with its departing watery recede. It left only one love, her love for the man who could never offer her the same. 
 
 When at last the wave crashed, the day came, he pulled from his pocket a silver locket, bearing his family crest. In handing it to her, he saw its kismet written plainly. To hang over Brandy's unfilled heart for the rest of her days, and to descend with her into the ground on her last, swallowed by the Earth and vanished with her forever. Though he was a brave man, seeing himself through the treacherous passions of the great ocean and ever coming out as victor, this time he was defeated by the eyes of his lover. Unable to bear the weight of their infinite hurt, he took her one last time into his arms, and kissed her lightly, slowly, trying to leave this impression within both of them as a form of remembrance. 
 
 Yet their lips parted, and so did they, as he turned from her and strode away with the now tattered remnants of his former lustrous stride. Never to return.

8353,"[ WP ] In the darkness , 'shadows ' are free to roam the Earth . On one particular night , a congregation of shadows discuss the horrors of the people they cast ...
","Hephziba and Abital are fighting again, just like they have been for the past decade. I need to stop haunting behind the 7/11, even if there is n't much else to do in this town. Hephziba's Cast turned in Abital's for cheating on the math test, even though they had a cheating pact. Abital's Cast is going to suspension for the next week, which mean's Abital has to be suspended for the entire next week. Nothing excited to watch from the comfort of your Cast's bedroom, that's for sure. 
 
 We Shadows get fairly bored in the evening as it is, and it's even more boring when the person you Cast is in still in grade school. Honestly, there is n't much to do as a Shadow besides getting overly involved with your Cast's life. I've casted hundreds of thousands of people by now, 
 
 Once and a while you cast someone exciting. I once casted a poor schmuck who wound up fighting in the Bolshevik revolution. He did n't make it through capturing the Winter Palace, unfortunately, and it did n't even know that whole effort had been successful until I casted a young man who eventually became a member of the Sikh regiment in India at the dawn of their independence. Those were some exciting Casts, let me tell you, even if every day I risked finding myself suddenly recasted ( and eventually I did, the poor guy. I hope they posthumously decorated him ). I was almost disappointed to get that future insurance auditor next, even if he did eventually become an alcoholic and kill himself. 
 
 And now my Cast is a bookish 12 year old, who spends no time around Hephziba's and Abital's Casts ( thank god, I can barely stand them in the evenings anymore, let alone during the day ). He currently wants to be a librarian, so I guess it's another few decades of small-town monotony for me. 
 
 Lemuel comes wandering up as Hephziba and Abital are going at it, referencing their Casts' various disagreements over the last half decade. Hopefully Abital's Cast's family moves soon, I ca n't take too much more of their bickering. Lemuel's Cast is usually the early to bed type, but it's now nearly 3am. I acknowledge his presence quietly, hoping he spent the last few hours finding a new haunt for our evenings. Though, the Shadow for Lemuel's Cast's wife is absent. They were like glue, even during the evenings. Our relations as Shadows get overly uncomfortable and rather forced ( my Cast has never married someone with a Shadow I like to be around ), but Lemuel and Junia always got along well enough to still associate at night. 
 
 `` Hey, I'm not going to be around too much longer,'' Lemuel sulks when the argument reaches a pause. 
 
 `` What?! Why?'' Abital asks, immediately dropping the incident at the middle school, `` What happened?'' 
 
 `` My Cast killed his wife today,'' Lemuel says quietly, `` Junia's already gone.'' 
 
 None of us know really what to say. Seeing thousands of deaths does n't really make the search for words any easier when one of us has to leave. The odds of you running into another Shadow again are slim, and Lemuel and Junia really did get along. It was like they were the ones married, not their Casts. 
 
 `` Shoot, are you going to jail?!'' Hephziba exclaims brusquely, `` Will they catch him?!'' 
 
 Lemuel shrugs. He's holding back tears, with emotions we Shadows usually do n't have. Junia must have been special. `` I hope he finishes himself off in the morning. The body's been lying around for a few hours now.'' 
 
 `` But, you'll be recast,'' Abital points out unhelpfully. While getting recast is an obnoxious pain in the ass ( YOU follow around a baby for a few years, I dare you! ), she's missing Lemuel's point completely. 
 
 Lemuel shrugs. `` Maybe I'll be recast with Junia. Twins or something.'' 
 
 `` The odds of that are pretty slim dude,'' Hephziba points out, coldly and rationally, `` I warned you, you two were too close.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, whatever,'' Lemuel spits in anger, `` I'm going back to the house. I just wanted to let you guys know I would n't be around anymore.'' 
 
 The two other Shadows do n't say anything. They long ago lost the empathy for this kind of situation. I have too, to be honest. I've met thousands of other Shadows, and none stay with me for more than a few decades. We lose each other too frequently to care. 
 
 `` Best of luck to you, Lemuel,'' I say quietly, trying not to sound like an asshole. I mean, what *do* you say? People die all the time, you get recast as someone else. As a Shadow, you do n't have control of where you go or who you are with. You just *are*. Sometimes your Casts live shit lives, sometimes they live great lives, and sometimes ( and worst of all ) they live mundane lives. Eventually they go, by nature or by murder or by accident, and you live alongside another life. Lemuel knows the cycle, even if he wanted to believe this casting was different. `` I wish you the best.'' 
 
 `` Thanks,'' he mutters, before disappearing back into the night. 
 
 Abital and Hephziba stay quiet for a few minutes before continuing their argument. I really need to find a new haunt.

119669,"[ WP ] [ NSFW ] When someone masturbates , the person they masturbate to feels it as well .
","It's weird. As we have evolved as humans, our capacity for empathy continued to increase, until eventually we could feel each other's emotional responses as they were happening. Despite the years of mandatory training, there is still the occasional story of a man or woman dying shortly after feeling the death of their spouse, or the reverberating anguish of hundreds of thousands when a natural disaster hits. With this empathy came a kind of forced world peace, as the horrors of war echoed in hears and souls worldwide. Crime too, plummeted as it was impossible to hide from the emotional turmoil of victims and their families. 
 
 And, in an interesting twist, our increased capacity for empathy has also resulted in the near-eradication of pornography. Adult film stars retired by the dozens. It must be difficult and personally embarrassing to feel hundreds of other people climaxing with you on their minds, and further, for that to happen several times a day. 
 
 I would n't know what it's like. Not personally anyway. No one thinks of me in their most intimate moments. I know that I have the same empathy as anyone else. The tests proved it; I can feel the happiness or sadness or hate of everyone around me. But I've never felt the distinct, tickling sensation of someone reaching climax, and thinking of me. 
 
 I'm so fucking lonely.

","Dr. Mathers stood by his machine, hand resting on a small red lever on its side. He was surrounded by peers, politicians, media, friends, and family. Decades of work had lead to this. They almost lost their research center on Mars a few months back, and nobody thought Chronos Labs could make the rebound and finish their machine. Through hard work and preservation, they managed. Cameras zoomed in on Dr. Mathers as he prepared to speak. 
 
 `` Hello everybody, I'd like to thank you all for showing up! We here at Chronos are so excited to finally be here, and begin to change the world'One second at a time'.'' The crowd chuckles at the mention of the lab's motto. `` Anyways, whatever happens when this switch flips will change our world, and possibly our universe, forever. At the very least, here's what we can expect. We have made preparations so that in approximately two years, our sending station will send back Dr. Renn to this time, as by that time we can be *assured* that the technology is safe. So, is everybody ready?'' 
 
 The crowd shifted behind their protective clothing and glasses, with a chorus of yes and a sea of thumbs up ensuing. Dr. Mathers smiled, and flipped the switch. There was a flash of light. Everyone recoiled by the sudden burst. After about a minute, the light subsided. At the bottom of the platform, a small metal box remained. The outside was scarred with burns. 
 
 Confused, Dr. Mathers picked the box up. The crowd watched incredulously as he opened it and produced a small paper note. Their curiosity grew as Dr. Mathers produced a grim expression. He staggered backwards, then collected himself. `` Uh... A-apparently there was a... an error. With the machine we have here. Not completely safe, it seems, yes. Luckily, ourselves from the future have... presented us with instructions on how to fix it.'' Dr. Mathers looked at the crowd expressionless. `` I'm afraid that's all that we have for now, we need to fix the machine. We did receive word from the future, though, which is monumental. Thank you all for coming, and we'll keep everyone updated on what's next.'' Without another word, Dr. Mathers retreated from the stage. 
 
 Dr. Mathers pored over the note back in his lab. *Destroyed... Life in the solar system destroyed by a pulsar... Dear god... * He paced back and forth. Nobody survived. The note was sent just before the destruction of the solar system, one year from next month. This meant something, though. This was a warning. With it was all of the research and progress made by a different Dr. Mathers, one who perished with his universe. Not before sending his progress to his past self, though. By the looks of the papers at the bottom of the box, this had happened at least a dozen other times. Dr. Mathers sat down and rubbed his eyes. He began to read.

","There is a card game I used to play with a few other writers while in college. It was called [ Once upon a time ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1cfcf7/writing_for_kids/ ). 
 
 Essentially, you pick a few cards from one deck and a happy ending from another deck. Then they do a group story. Each card has something that may end up in a story a ring, a princess, etc. Your goal is to play all your cards and get to your happy ending. 
 
 I would use the same idea have the kids pick cards and write a story based on the cards they pick. You could also have them pick from pieces of paper in a hat. 
 
 They can use the items however they see fit. But the story has to make sense and be a certain amount of words.

","
 `` Well I do n't know what happened but *It* definitely happened in your zone, so get to it and fix it or I assure you the entire blame will fall on you,'' said Astaroth, Duke of Hell, and that was it. You could n't think to argue with a Duke, especially when you were only an intern. 
 
 You left the ofice, taking a last dejected look at the plastic plants that tried to make it homely. You knew your job was on the line, but seriously, this was your first day on the god -sorry- helldamned work. 
 
 `` Nothing to it, really. Either I solve this and float or its back to the Pool of Eternal Punishment for the Procastinators,'' you thought. 
 
 Outside the office, that had central heating, waited a frozen wasteland, with demons and lost soulds looking extremely confused. Hell was n't designed to freeze, the torture chambers used lava for half the tortures. And it was just bad for the trademark. This was important. 
 
 So you took the elevator to Earth and flew as fast as you could to your zoning. Each minute was a minute that Astaroth was thinking of a new punishment if you failed, you knew, so you had to hurry. 
 
 The source of meta-magical energy was coming from a nearby pasta restaurant. Confused, you turned invisible and went inside, avoiding the influx of customers. 
 
 “ They have to be the source, ” you thought, looking at the young couple sitting in a table at the corner. She was smiling shyly at him, while he tried to split a slice of pizza for her and tangled his hands with the hot cheese. 
 
 “ But why? ” they didn ’ t look like the usual warlocks, or the pious monks that normally were the cause of such problems. They were just a normal, awkward couple in their first date. 
 
 It made no sense, and you had no experience in the field ( and you spent the time you were alive redditing ), and the minutes were trickling and you could feel Astaroth getting angrier and angrier. 
 
 “ What is going on? ” To a demon, time and Space were things that you read in the C3b report at the office. So you went into the future and saw that they were getting married and living happily, yet a bit bored, for a long time. But nothing to do with the goddam -jeez, sorry- satandamned freezing spell that had taken hell by their collective horns. 
 
 Out of ideas, you went into the past. Not surprisingly, they hadn ’ t met before: He saw their first day at their jobs, their first day of college, their first significant others… Nothing about… Oh. 
 
 Thirty years ago, and you saw it as if you were there. Because you were. Remember, that about time and space? 
 
 “ No way! Forget about it! ” Yelled the girl, shaking her head so hard her ponitails shaked all around her head. “ I ’ ll never date such a prick like you! You are mean and smelly and a *boy* ” 
 
 “ You don ’ t have to put it like that, I bet you could date me, my aunt says I ’ m going to be a very handsome man, ” answered the boy, his face red with shame. 
 
 “ I said no way! ” Said the girl. And then: “ Hell would have to freeze over first, you nitwick! ” 
 
 You went back to hell in a hurry, and talked to Paradoxical Department, because it was not your problem after all, but theirs. They had to learn to read the paperwork that came from Earth with more attention. 
 
 And a couple aeons later, you had a promotion. It was a happy ending, except for all the torture of lost souls.

","Stephen grinned. 
 
 It had n't been one moment, or even a single year. He had clawed his way up from nothing, and it had taken a while. As he watched the last penny drip in, the big 1,000,000,000, he felt his eyes watering with relief. He raised his bony hand to wipe away the tear. 
 
 He stood up, a billionaire. He decided he would go to the kitchen and have coffee like a billionaire. No matter how far he climbed, his tastes had stayed simple. He put a pod in the Keurig and started it, recalling the time so many years ago when he had been thinking over a cup of this very brew. He had decided to become a billionaire. From that moment, nothing else mattered. Relationships came and went, his family had long ago departed from his life. After so many business kick-started and subsequently sold, his colleagues had changed every few months. 
 
 Stephen suddenly realized that he was lonely. 
 
 It had n't crossed his mind in years. His family had screamed it at him, lovers had choked through tears to deliver that one last stinging remark. All of a sudden it all became real. Stephen found himself curled up into the tightest ball he could manage, whimpering softly and wishing his mother were there to comfort him. He wished he had given Melissa more attention, wished that he'd listened to Caroline's stories a little closer. 
 
 It was about this time that a knock came at the door. Stephen hoped desperately that it would be somebody, anybody that he could talk to. He straightened himself up, wiped away the tears and went to answer the door with the best smile he could manage. As he opened the door he was disappointed to see nobody there. He looked left and right to make sure before turning his gaze towards a large box sitting at his feet. 
 
 It was a crate, about six feet wide, eight food long, and four feet deep. On the top was an envelope, wrapped in a ribbon and sealed with a dark green'G'. Intrigued, Stephen opened the envelope. 
 
 -- -- 
 
 *Stephen, * 
 I hope this letter finds you in good health. It has come to my attention that you have reached the `` Billionaire's Club''. Congratulations on your wealth, now I'm sure you're wondering what to do with it. 
 This box contains one million envelopes, and notes to go with all of them. You can use your money as you see fit, but think for a moment on those people who still need money. The simple split is one thousand dollars to a million different people. But for the rest of your life you could be sending out one of these envelopes with a not-insubstantial amount of money every day. 
 Being rich is lonely, as I'm sure you've found discovered. This is a chance to give it all away and return to the life you left behind. 
 
 Do what feels right. 
 
 Signed, God 
 
 P.S. Being above it all is n't all that exciting. 
 
 -- -- 
 
 Stephen folded the letter and put it back in the envelope, deep in thought. As he opened the box and took out the first envelope, he saw it was addressed to his mother. She had started to go downhill fast and was currently in a nursing home. He found the corresponding note, sat on the box and took out a pen.

 They are not. For now. 
 
 I instead catch a glimpse of myself in the reflection, a withered man hyperventilating on the verge of a panic attack looking restless, tired, alone. No time to stop to think about that now. The documents I've seized are groundbreaking; it could potentially change the world as we know it and finally expose the true criminals of this earth yet... yet I am fearful.

 The dozen or so jumpsuit-clad goons charged at the ancient woman in pairs or trios, only to collapse in shattered, similarly grouped heaps. Her grandchildren watched in an ambivalent fusion of shock and horror as Jacqueline Rosemary Thompson, age 92, elbowed a man twice her size and a third her age directly in his Adam's apple. She then spun around and yanked out the next assailant's septum piercing, before uppercutting the young woman off her feet. 
 
 And then, just like that, it was over. Any remaining aggressors who could still stand scattered and ran, leaving the bulk of their cohorts behind. Nana Jacqueline plodded over to the young woman she'd floored, who was now gushing blood from her nose and mouth. 
 
 `` Move your hand, honey, and let me take a look,'' the old woman cooed, wrenching the bloodied girl's hands away from her face. `` Oh, my -- that's quite the bang-up, child. Here... let me help.'' 
 
 Nana leaned all her weight on the girl's throat, causing her to thrash and twitch and claw at the mauve carpet, and then, finally, to lie eerily still. The old woman tutted disappointedly after realizing her uppercut had launched the young lady directly into the credenza, splintering the family heirloom in two. 
 
 `` Hello, dearies,'' Nana Jacqueline chortled at her grandchildren, still standing in the doorway with their mouths agape. `` Terribly sorry about the mess. I just was n't expecting any sort of company this morning.''

","`` Mr. President, I give you Elf # 4606.'' The agent nodded towards a vacant seat that sat parallel to the President's desk. 
 
 `` Elf # 4306 was my slave name. I now go by'Garry.'' Garry stated as he took his seat. 
 
 `` Garry the Elf?'' queried the President. 
 
 `` Just Garry will do. I no longer wish to go by the'Elf' moniker.'' 
 
 The President looked down at his notes, looked up at Garry, then looked back down at his notes. `` These are some serious allegations, Garry. If this is true and we release it to the public we'll be headed for a disaster of biblical proportions, real wrath of God type stuff.'' 
 
 Agent Peck - the President's Head of Security - chirped up, looking over at the President from across the room. `` Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies! Rivers and seas boiling!'' 
 
 `` Forty years of darkness! Earthquakes, volcanoes...'' shouted the President 
 
 Agent Peck was now at the President's desk and they were both standing. `` The dead rising from the grave!'' 
 
 `` Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together.. mass hysteria!'' 
 
 Agent Peck and the President were now laughing and high-fiving. `` You watched it last night too?'' Asked the President. 
 
 `` Of course!'' replied Agent Peck. 
 
 `` It's from Ghostbusters, Garry. Ghostbusters.'' The President explained to the former Elf. 
 
 `` I know it's from Ghostbusters. I've seen Ghostbusters.'' replied Garry with irate undertones. 
 
 `` Of course you've seen Ghostbusters.'' said the President. `` Everybody has seen Ghostbusters. It's fantastic, Garry.'' 
 
 Garry was becoming noticeably upset. `` I feel like you're not taking this seriously, sir. There is a man living at the North Pole with a slave army obeying his every word through fear of death.'' 
 
 Agent Peck walked back to his area towards the door of the office. A solemn aura painted the President as he, once again, looked towards his notes. `` I assure you, we are treating this case with the utmost respect. If we are honest with you, this is something we have known about for a long time. The Pentagon is well aware of Saint Nicholas and the atrocities he has committed.'' 
 
 `` Then why have n't you done anything about it?! Do you know what I have gone through?! How hard it was to escape?!'' 
 
 `` It's a difficult situation, Garry. You must understand.'' 
 
 `` No. Fuck you and fuck everybody who has allowed this to continue. My family have died under the stewardship of that fat bastard. Everyone I have loved has fell beneath his black boots.'' 
 
 The President looked beyond sympathetic yet also powerless. There was something looming over him, controlling him like a puppet even though every inch of his being wanted to fight. He once again looked down at his notes, almost afraid to cross eyes with Gary the former Elf. 
 
 Seconds passed but the tension in the room transformed them in to hours. 
 
 `` What is it you're looking at?'' queried Garry. 
 
 `` What?'' The President hastened to cover the documents on his desk. 
 
 Garry sprung from his chair in a bid to snatch the documents. A scuffle broke out between the President and Garry. A single shot was fired in to the air from Agent Peck's gun and his order bellowed. `` MOVE AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT THIS INSTANT OR THE NEXT BULLET WILL BE IN YOUR HEAD!'' 
 
 Paper rained from the sky as the President and Garry sat panting on opposite sites of the room - Garry with the protected document in hand. 
 
 `` Is this what I think it is?'' mumbled Garry, tears slowly pacing down his face. 
 
 `` Yes.'' admitted the President. `` It's the super sweet Uncharted PS4 bundle Santa promised me for Christmas. I'm so sorry. I was XBOX before the PS4 so I never got to play the trilogy. I'm just a man, Garry. I ca n't withstand his grip. I'm just a man!'' The President was a wreck. 
 
 Agent Peck, throwing his gun across the room in anger, bowed his head. He knew the President. He knew he was a moral man. He also knew Santa's iron-like grip was too difficult to fight. `` It truly is a super sweet bundle.'' he muttered as his voice broke with emotion. 
 
 The President rose to his feet. `` Maybe one day we will be able to fight Santa Claus and liberate all of those held hostage by him. But that day is not now, Garry. As long as he is able to deliver wicked cool gifts like this'', the President held up a document containing an image of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, `` we will never be able to defeat him. I'm sorry.'' 
 
 Garry was heartbroken. The tears had dried up but that was only because his spirit had left him. Looking to his side, he saw Agent Peck's gun, picked it up, and pointed the barrel at the temple of his head. `` You're responsible for this.'' he muttered before pulling the trigger. 
 
 Blood spattered all over the Oval Office. The President gazed at Garry's lifeless carcass. `` No.'' he said. `` the new Samsung 48 ” Smart 4K Ultra HD TV is.''

 `` I wish, Tony, but I got ta go see my daughter's recital. How's about tomorrow night?'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` Alright, Jack, but you're going to miss out on the big game tonight!'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` Well, tell me who wins!'' I yelled back at Tony as we departed to our cars. I set my briefcase down as I pulled out my phone, looking at the clock that flickered onto the screen. It read 7:45. `` Shit, I'm going to be late to Sarah's recital.'' 
 
 
 
 
 I fumbled my hand in my pocket for a few seconds, frustratingly moving between my wallet and the skin of the pocket's lining as I tried to drag the big wad of keys out from my pants. Finally, I pulled them out and opened up the door, tossing my briefcase onto the passenger's seat as I sat down on the driver's seat and closed the door. 
 
 
 
 
 I took a small sigh of relief as my back melded with the leather seating of my BMW. But my relaxation disappeared as I heard it. A single beep, so eerie and out of place. Was it someone unlocking their car? No; it was those numbers popping up, in a crimson red tone, in the backseat of my car. `` 5:00''; it sat there, nearly motionless, with only the small flickering of the screen to remind me that whatever this thing was, it was active. For a moment, I thought it was a prank by Tony. He'd put an alarm clock in my car, probably from when he caught me sleeping in the underground parking garage many months ago. But that would've only made sense if this clock was plugged into a wall outlet. 
 
 
 
 
 My suspicions were confirmed as a number popped up on my screen. There were no numbers, only the word `` RESTRICTED'', as I slowly answered the phone. `` H-Hello? Who is this?'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` In the next few moments, the bomb in the back of your car will be activated. You have five minutes to live. If you move suddenly, the bomb will detonate automatically. If you do nothing, the bomb will detonate when it reaches zero. Choose what you do with these next few minutes wisely. They will be your last.'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?!'' I screamed at the phone as sweat began to pour down my forehead. Tears began to form, struggling to contain themselves in my eyes, and struggling to flow down my cheeks as I continued to yell at the phone. `` Answer me!'' But there was no answer, and there was no one else on the line any longer. As I gently put down the phone, I looked back at the red lights and saw 5:00 turn into 4:59. Then 4:58,4:57, 4:56... Dear God, what was I going to do? 
 
 
 
 
 I turned on the light in my car and looked at the black box, full of multiple wires arching all over the figure. I tried to think of which wires to pull or to cut, but I was no bomb expert. I'm a fucking accountant! I crunch numbers, not explosives! My hands began to tremble as I tried to grasp different wires, but fear turned my sweaty palms into impossible grasps. I decided to stop trying to defuse the bomb, and pulled my hand away. 
 
 
 
 
 I began to cry, realizing this was my end. I was n't going to see my daughter graduate. I was n't going to see my daughter get married. I was n't going to see my grandkids, and I surely was n't going to see a single wrinkle on Debra's face; my beautiful wife. Although maybe that last one was a blessing in disguise. 
 
 
 
 
 I made a small chuckle at my own misguided humour and slowly placed my hands together, praying to God, or Allah, or Shiva, or something. I did n't even know what. I was never a very religious man, and was more focused on my life than I was on life after death. But now being on death's doorstep, it was finally time to trying to get something's attention, hoping that this was n't the end of ever seeing my family again. And if it was, I prayed that they at least got some protection after my demise. 
 
 
 
 
 I opened my eyes and looked back at the clock. 2:47, 2:46, 2:45... Wow, time sure was flying by fast. I would've thought that my last moments would've felt like an eternity, but it seems like I just was n't a lucky man. Then again, most men do n't end up being strapped to a 2-ton bomb. Man did I hope I would n't end up being labeled a terrorist or something along those lines. I mean are we really still scared of terrorism? It's not like we've been attacked any time recently. But man would it suck for Debra and Sarah to be seen as the beloved ones of a suicide bomber. Speaking of which, I sure as hell hoped they did n't think I'd end my life, especially not this way. 
 
 
 
 
 I snapped myself out of it. I only have a little over two minutes to live, and yet here I was, talking to myself over some trivial matter. I needed to hear Debra's voice one more time, and hopefully get a small glimpse of Sarah's recital. I sure as hell was not going to calm down with seeing numbers ticking away with every breath I took. 
 
 
 
 
 I opened my phone's contact list and pulled up Debra's number, calling as I waited for her to pick up. Every one of the long notes, informing you that the call was connecting, I gulped a little harder. What if she did n't pick up? What if I went with my last moments not even getting to hear her soft voice one last time? I gulped deeply, as my throat became a lead weight with each passing note. But finally, there she was, her soft voice speaking into the phone. 
 
 
 
 
 `` Hello?'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` Hey, honey. How's the recital going?'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` It's just about to begin. Where are you, Jack?'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` I'm still at work, honey. I ran into some issues before I left.'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` Well just hurry over here. Sarah ca n't wait to show you her skills. She's becoming a real ballerina.'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` That's amazing, honey.'' I began to gently cry and sniffed. `` Well unfortunately I ca n't make it, honey. Something's come up.'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` What could possibly be more important than your daughter's big night? You're really going to disappoint her, Jack.'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` I-I know, honey. But you'll understand soon why I could n't make it.'' My sobs became clearer as I cried into the phone.

","One'd think it to be easy to flip a bottle and get a million views. But not for me. I had started my YouTube channel with the Harlem Shake series, because I was so good at'em. Like, exceptionally good. So good that when you search for harlem shake on YouTube, the first video that comes up is mine. The second video that comes up is mine. The third.... 
 
 Yea, the whole series comes up in order, after which other uploader's content comes up. But hey, I just guess I maxed out on my luck. 
 
 Two trends, two! And I am capable of doing none of'em. What were the chances, I ask myself. Mannequin Challenge. Just does n't happen at all. My knees wo n't lock, I feel fidgety, my crotch itches, the list goes on and on.... 
'Flip a bottle' Challenge. By the time this came up, I did n't even have to try it. I had by now realized that I lack proper hand - to -eye coordination. 
 
 `` Hey, listen, mate. Just hold these balls near your chest, and throw'em up in the air, up till your head. That way, you get time to catch both the balls. `` 
 
 But did I listen? Did I? 
 
 It was a 2 hour session of juggling basics. I sucked so badly that by the end I was n't even able to catch a mildly thrown ball towards me. While my neighbor, he was done with juggling balls. He was now juggling bowling pins. Four of them. While holding another bowling pin over his forehead. 
 
 It was a mess. This whole year was n't profitable to my channel at all. People kept asking me there, `` Are you dead?'', which would be followed with 10 `` yes, I think so ``, and 22 of `` I am going to fuck your mother now that you're dead.'' 
 
 I thought of ending all of this. As I was walking on the Carnival Road, I switched to the front cam, and started shooting. `` Hi, guys. I am really sorry. I am not dead, as you would believe. And, I'd love you guys to give my mother some company, because she is so lonely these days. But, though I ai n't dead, I think I am.......'' I had to pause. Myself and my phone. I locked my phone and my knees in position. Because I was witnessing something. In Live Action. Like in real life, I mean. not Facebook Live or Twitch and stuff. There was this girl, prolly have my age, flipping bottles. With both hands. Oh fuck, she flipped a bottle exact by just kicking! 
 
 `` Hey pretty lady, may I ask your name?'' 
 
 `` Alex'' 
 
 `` Alex. You're cute. And talented. I'd like to video this stuff that you're doing right now. I'll give you a share of the profits too.'' 
 
 `` Mommy! Another guy has come who says he'll pay me for videoing `` 
 
 `` Hey punk! Fuck off. Do n't you dare do....'' 
 
 I did n't want to listen to her finish. Maybe I was n't able to let her finish. Maybe it is true. I might be autistic. 
 
 I call Korner. 
 
 `` I guess you might be right. I might be autistic.''

223415,"[ WP ] It has been raining for as long as anyone can remember .
","Thunder rumbled in the distance, mingling with the crashing of massive boulders raining from the sky. Straining to peer out the reinforced windows, Amelia climbed one rung higher on the access ladder, fairly trembling with excitement as she searched the gray clouds. For what, exactly, she did n't know, but then again, nobody did. A Besieger, some called them. God, others said, though in Amelia's opinion a god who would do this was no god at all. But whatever it was, she wanted to find it. She wanted to observe it, study it, pinpoint its weaknesses. And kill it. 
 
 Amelia was only nine-and-a-half, but already she knew what she would do with her life. She dreamed of reclaiming the surface, of ending the rain and the earthquakes; the barrages of rocks that dropped from the sky, crushing viewports and expedition teams alike. 
 
 As she watched, a dark speck moved against the clouds, no more than a pinpoint even with her mom's biggest binoculars. It wavered in the misty air, blurring and almost seeming to grow in size. 
 
 Dropping the binoculars, which caught themselves on a ribbon around her neck, Amelia scrambled down the ladder two rungs at a time, jumping the last few feet to the floor and darting into the first open corridor. 
 
 A second later, the boulder smashed into her window and fell, scraping against the tunnel walls before it embedded itself in the concrete floor. Plexiglas shards rained down in its wake, and Amelia turned, pulled the alarm and ran as she felt the first drops of acid rain splatter her skin. Her hands curled into fists as she buried her fear and shock under anger – what would do this, and why? Could n't they live in peace? 
 
 `` What are you doing up here?'' her mother shrieked in horror as they collided around a bend. `` There's been a breach–'' 
 
 `` I know, Ma, I reported it.'' 
 
 `` You were n't up in that damn hatch again–'' 
 
 `` Do n't worry. I did n't lose your binoculars.'' 
 
 `` I'm not worried about the binoculars! I do n't want you up here anymore. Stay in Bedrock where it's safe.'' 
 
 `` But Ma,'' Amelia protested, `` I've got to find the Besiegers. So we can figure out how to kill them.'' 
 
 `` Honey, nobody can kill them,'' her mother sighed. `` They're been here as long as anybody remembers. If it was possible, do n't you think we'd have done it by now?'' 
 
 `` Maybe not,'' Amelia stubbornly insisted as her mother led her away, back into the depths.

148764,"[ WP ] For the first time , SETI is receiving a constant signal from deep space . A team is assembled to attempt to make sense of the signal . It turns out that the signal was in English .
","The world was watching SETI that morning. Every major network was there, along with bloggers and scientists and writers. Everyone wanted to be there for the reveal. 
 
 SETI had recently announced that they had detected a signal from deep space, and unlike anything else they had ever seen before, this was n't a one-off anomaly. This was a constant message, repeating every few seconds. Finally, there was proof that we were not alone! And today, they were releasing the message! 
 
 The buzz of noise fell to silence as a man in a suit stepped up to the podium. He looked a little bit sick, though, as many reporters said live to their viewers, it was probably because he realized that he was quite literally speaking to the entire world. 
 
 If only that were true. 
 
 The man at the podium cleared his throat. `` As you know, approximately three months ago we detected an anomalous signal on our Deep Space Network. It was determined to be a message that repeated itself every four seconds. That is the limit of what we told you last week, because that is the limit of what we ourselves knew.'' 
 
 He swallowed as the cameras flashed in his face. 
 
 `` Today, I am here to share that message with you.'' 
 
 A cheer went up from the gathered crowd. 
 
 `` This is the original message itself. All that we have done is converted the file from a binary set of 1s and 0s to an audio file.'' 
 
 He turned to the speaker system that had been connected to the SETI network specifically for this message, before they had decifered its hidden meaning. He slowly raised the remote control, and, hands shaking, pressed PLAY. 
 
 Two seconds later, a collective gasp went up from the gathered crowd. It was in English? But how? 
 
 It took until the third loop for the people's noise to quiet down enough to truly understand the words of the message. 
 
 `` They are coming for you... Run..... They are coming for you... Run.....'' 
 
 As the crowd began screaming questions, begging for answers, the man stopped the playback and turned back to the microphones. Taking a deep breath, he began again to address the world. 
 
 `` As of yet, we have no theories. No idea who sent it. No idea how it is in English. No idea what we're supposed to be running-'' 
 
 He cut off as the sun was suddenly covered in shadow. Slowly lifting his head, he took in the magnificence of the descending starship.

","“ Come here, shhhh! Come on! ” Michael beckons the cameramen into his office as he rushes forward excitedly in a ninja-like crouch. He knocks into Jim ’ s desk, knocking over his pencil holder, spilling the contents all over the floor and causing a scene. Michael begins to pick up the pencils but shortly gives up, throwing the pencils back onto the floor. “ Whatever. ” He continues into his office, the cameramen remain. Michael slams his blinds closed, rattling the window, and then he opens a crevice large enough for his face to peak out, his eyes bulged. 
 
 Jim smirks at the camera, then at Pam ’ s indifference. Everyone else continues to work, apathetic. 
 
 Cut to inside Michael ’ s darkened office. Without any words he stifles his laughter as his hands slowly move to his face, holding a fake mustache. He sticks it above his lip, crooked. In a racially insensitive timbre, he exclaims, “ I am Esteban. O, si, si! ” He laughs at himself before reverting back to his normal voice, “ I am- ” he immediately starts giggling before changing his voice again, “ You no taco for you! ” His laughing increases. 
 
 Fade into short shots around Michaels closed office, muffled laughing ringing out, everyone going about their work, happily ignoring Michael ’ s secrecy. Cut to Michael, still with the crooked moustache, his composure normalized. “ I ’ ve discovered two great, great things this weekend. I was surfing the web and I stumbled upon this game that everyone is talking about called Second Life. So I checked it out, and yeah I know, NERD, right? Derrrr! Seven. Two. Nine. Alpha. Noob! Noob! ” He makes his pointer fingers and thumbs into circles and frames his eyes, making his voice slightly nasally. He pauses and eases his smile away before he continues, “ But no, it ’ s not like that at all. Basically, it ’ s a game where you create, a second life for yourself, to escape your first one, but in this one you don ’ t have to breathe, you don ’ t have to eat. You fly, and you become a Movie Star and you don ’ t have to pay bills, it ’ s great. ” Cut to Michael ’ s second life profile, his avatar wearing a suit, tall and buff beyond the point of uncanny valley, wearing sunglasses, slicked, black hair, and holding a machine gun. “ In my second life I am named Michael Scarn, I am a secret agent, actor, philanthropist, helping all those in need. And I met this little guy. His name was Esteban Winsmore. He was a Mexican elf horse and all he wanted to do was follow me around. I. Made a difference in his life. ” Esteban Winsmore follows Michael, scripting explosions around him, using an enlarged horse head to trap Michael Scarn out of view everywhere he travelled. Esteban Winsmore tells Michael he is his family, his home, as the camera zooms out and shows Michael tearing up at his computer screen and smiling. “ So I played, talking to Esteban the whole time, exploring, making memories, and then I ran into Dwight, who just ruined the whole thing for me. ” Cuts to footage of Dwight ’ s second life avatar, finding Michael, Esteban Winsmore ’ s horse head trailing behind. 
 
 “ Michael? ” His avatar makes the motion of typing as text pops into Michaels computer screen. The camera zooms out to show Michael with a straight, unnerved expression. 
 
 Back to the Michael ’ s office, “ He was a paper salesman? I mean come on, that ’ s so silly, so stupid. So anyways, after he ruined that good thing for me I started to watch this show called Undercover Boss, and that was, pretty great. ” He chuckles to himself as a smile emerges. “ It ’ s about a boss of a company, dressing up as someone completely different, and he spies on his trusted colleagues, the worker bees, to see if he could get any dirt on them, to unveil the secrets they tell around the water-cooler, to get in their heads and become equals, to become friends. He fools everyone, and at the end the best workers get a thousand dollars. And the worst employees are exposed to the whole world, and everyone looks at the boss like he ’ s a hero. 
 
 “ So, today what we are going to do, ” he reaches under his desk and pulls out a warehouse uniform, “ is undercover boss everyone. I ’ m going to be the loving companion to them, get under their skin, learn their secrets. I ’ m going to be an Esteban. I. Will. Decide. Who gets the thousand dollars at the end of the day. Starting with warehouse. ” 
 
 Michael emerges from his office, hiding the warehouse uniform under his suit jacket, bulging it out. Everyone remains indifferent and working. The cameras follow Michael downstairs as he reaches the men ’ s bathroom door, which is closed off by wet floor signs. Michael moves them out of the way, nods, and closes it. The cameras turn and focus on a confused janitor, walking out from a hallway. Michael emerges, wearing the moustache and the uniform, as he leaves his other clothes on the floor of the bathroom. The janitor tries to tell Michael something but he shoos him off. “ I don ’ t speaka Engliss, ” he says in an accent. 
 
 Michael walks around to the back, towards the warehouse garages. Darryl is loading boxes when Michael walks up to him. In a loud, overdramatic accent, “ I am Esteban. I am looking for wor- ” 
 
 “ What are you doing Michael? ” 
 
 “ God! ” Michael brings his voice back to normal, “ Damn. ” Michael storms off, back to the front of the office. He stomps into the bathroom, and water splashes up onto his ankles. The floor is soaked in large puddles, his suit completely drenched. The janitor opens the bathroom door. “ There ’ s leaking toilet, that ’ s why I closed it off. ” 
 
 Cut to Michael walking into his office, defeated and angry, holding his wet clothes and still wearing the warehouse uniform and moustache. Jim turns, “ Michael? ” 
 
 “ Pick up your pencils. ” He slams his office door. The camera zooms near Jim ’ s desk. There are no pencils on the floor. Pam starts to silently giggle, trying to suppress it at the same time. 
 
 Cut to Michael, the disheveled moustache hanging off his lip. “ No one gets the thousand dollars. No one. Everyone loses. Mission accomplished. ” He rips the moustache off his face, and the little, sticky strand leaves a mark, “ Ow! God- ”

53425,"[ WP ] The apocalypse comes , but in a way nobody expects .
","One month ago all the scientists in the world agreed upon a single conclusion. The Grand Unified Theory was finally solved. Human beings were that much more closer to learning everything about the universe. During this time all the astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, and everyone one else really smart came together and worked together to solve new complex models further proposed from the newly solved Grand Unified Theory. Everyone worked together to discuss new machines and various electronics that would further reveal the mysteries of the universe. Spaceships were the new popular talk. Spaceships with black hole generators. These new ships would finally solve our interplanetary and interstellar space traveling problems. 
 
 Very unfortunately during this time, while all the astronomers were discussing space travel, an asteroid the size of the moon was headed straight for earth. There was no chance of avoiding it. Even with the knowledge of Black Hole Generators and trying to send all the nukes into the asteroid, there was not enough time to build it. The amateur astronomers found the giant asteroid, who then told the professional astronomers, who then told the other scientists who were about to tell the president. During all this somehow the media found out and told the public about the impending doom. 
 
 The world went into chaos. Cities were ravaged and plundered, burned and destroyed. The worlds population went into a harsh decline. The remaining humans must have believed the world was destroyed even before the asteroid arrived. And then the asteroid came. The remaining humans and all the life of the planet looked up in the air, waiting for the ball in the sky to fall onto them. The moon sized asteroid, seemingly going as slow as it can, was now closer than the actual moon. It suddenly stopped. 
 
 The asteroid began to circle the Earth as if it became our new moon. But during this time it was sending a message. Probably a telepathic message to all living things on Earth. 
 
 `` Hey, I've been warning all of you! Why did you stay here? I told you the Planet-Eater is coming. Whatever guys, I'm leaving.'' 
 
 The asteroid left faster than it came. A minute later an indescribable giant monster became the sky. Nothing was left of the blue vast sky, no sun, no stars, only darkness. What happened to the Earth no one knows because no one saw anything. The last things heard to anything left alive were probably the words `` That one was soggy.''

","All of my friends had done it. Most of my family members had done it. But I did n't care. There was no way that I was going to go into that booth. I just did n't trust it. But staying out of the Booth simply was n't an option any more, and that realization was slowly creeping deeper into the depths of my psyche with each passing day. 
 
 To sum it up, the people of the world were much different now, and I just did n't fit in anymore. I might as well have been a Neanderthal who was just thawed out into the present day. 
 
 Basically, everyone that had gone into the Booth had come out different than they had been before. The weird thing is, most of them were n't depressed, suicidal, or homicidal after they emerged. They were *jaded*. Nothing could bother a person after they had `` died.'' 
 
 Wife did n't clean the house while you were at work? `` Whatever, it's not like it will kill me.'' Long line at the bank? `` Who cares, no one has ever died from boredom.'' Steak came back a little too well-done? `` Meh, I'll live.'' 
 
 After the world came out of the Booth, it had a different perspective on life. The big problems in life would eventually sort themselves out, and the little problems did n't matter at all. Advertising for the Booth claimed that it was like tossing a penny into the fountain of youth, where you would never be bothered by anything ever again. But there was a flip-side to that coin. Sure, you would n't be bothered by anything, but you would never be *excited* by anything, either. People who used the booth continued in their `` Afterlife'' in a state of contented melancholy. The worst part of it was that these people thought that they reached a sort of Enlightenment when they legitimately stared into the face of Death. They could n't be bothered to get fixed, because they legitimately were n't bothered by the problem. 
 
 The only thing that affected the Boothers were people who had never gone into the booth. I ca n't tell you how many times I've been called an `` Ape'', a `` Grounder'', or a `` Peasant'' by people who fancied themselves `` Afterlifers,'' `` Ascendants,'' or `` Angels.'' I did n't think that 20 year olds could get any more arrogant until I met some that had already killed themselves. 
 
 I looked into the mirror of my bathroom. The gun was in my hand. I could n't live in a world where I was considered a second class citizen. But I also did n't want to live in a world that was devoid of any personal meaning. Bitter tears streamed down my face as I pulled the trigger.... 
 
 `` How was it, honey?'' My boyfriend greeted me outside the Booth in the bright, sleek showroom. Hundreds of eyes, wide from anticipation, stared at me eagerly from the long line that entered into the store. I could see that the queue snaked around the building through the large storefront windows. Reporters and camera crews, eager to get the first interview, rushed up to me. Journalists with their own cameras snapped pictures of me and the banners behind the Booths that read `` Experience the After Life!'' and `` Grand Opening!'' The ticker behind me turned from # 1 to # 2, and the attendant yelled `` Next in line!'' 
 
 I turned to my boyfriend to answer his question. Balloons and confetti fell around me in celebration of the first successful use of the Afterlife Booth. 
 
 `` Meh,'' I said.

","`` I can not take on another flame, little one.'' The rasp of brittle, ageless bark pressed against itself, forming words heard once a generation. The Guardian knew this dance well, far better than anyone supplicant could. The young girl before it could n't have been more than nine. The crimson rags of the Pact bunched around her shoulders and sagged ever closer to her ankles. She cowered before the Guardian's massive frame, unable to speak more than whispers in the presence of the oaken giant. The jet black of its bark was intertwined with the half-melted remains of Century Candles, made each generation just for this purpose. Each one nestled amongst the boughs of the Guardian's oasis, one of the few remaining `` trees'' found in the grasslands. She mused how the stars dotted themselves upon this ancient thing, hopeful that her candle would join its sisters within the canopy of night. 
 
 `` Nnn...'' Rags shifted, shuffling from their designated holds to reveal the malnourished youth beneath. The little girl's arms stretched out, thin as twigs, but no great progress was made. Even at her zenith, the candle in her hands had only risen inches toward her goal. She stared up at the sky above her, praying that the goliath would shrink so she could place the candle in its rightful home. It did n't move though, aside from the rustle of a pre-dawn breeze that was sure to bring rain. She shivered at the prospect of rain reaching her before the Guardian accepted her gift, dousing her light and life. Amongst the boughs it could be safe though, and the shivering ceased. She stretched her arms until each ached under their own weight and the rags bunched around her head. 
 
 `` Did the monks teach you the words, little one?'' Again the rasp bellowed from the Guardian mossy face, bring the sweet smell of peace-blooms with it. The girl suckled at the smell, its warmth filling her more than a month's worth of `` rations.'' She exhaled, letting a `` mmm'' slip from between her lips as it left. Her arms lowered a bit, the warmth of its voice coddling her. She let thoughts of home and family set in, and the sleeves of her ratty robe sagged down over her forearms. Realizing how low her candle had fallen, the girl quickly shook her memories into the dust and pressed her assault once more. 
 
 `` Nnn...'' Standing on her tippy toes, the candle seemed so much closer to its goal. Her feet dug into the moss beneath her, warming her toes with a tingle. A giggle rose in her throat as strands fine as floss brushed against her soles. But now was not the time, and she stifled it before it could find freedom. Glowing ovals peered down at her, each as large as a boulder. Looking into them, the girl felt the weight of the ancient thing staring back at her -- through her. 
 
 `` Do you know any words?'' The rasp rose into a clatter, choking out a twinge of frustration. The Guardian had little patience for extending the dance which would already take far longer than it liked. Its outstretched, gnarled hand pointed in the direction of the village the girl had come from. It was as much a land-marker as a life-form, and eternity had n't shaken its temperament one bit. The girl, although almost mute in her own, understood what the Guardian asked of her. Slowly, she shook her head, fearing that the answer would meet with stern disapproval. 
 
 `` How could this be? Are there no monks in your village to teach?'' The Guardian seemed shaken by the truth of the girl's action, more so than a thousand summer rains could have done. The monks had always been in the village, and had always taught the supplicants the words of the wood. The ritual of the Century Candle was as much a tradition as it was a test. A test to prove that its language still thrived in the world; moving from tongue to tongue, though the Guardian had long since taken root at the foot of this hill. For the first time in its life, the Guardian felt alone -- felt loss. Taking the candle in one hand, the girl drove her other deep into the robe, pulling a familiar object from some unknown pocket. A tiny, silk bandanna fluttered in the breeze, but the Guardian recognized the symbol brazened upon it even now. The mark it had once charged the monks to carry across the grasslands glowed golden against the soft blue of the silk. It was meant for the villages, as a mark for members of the Guardian's words. The girl drew the silk to her forehead, but found herself fumbling and unable to keep it in place with only one hand. A squeak of dismay wormed its way from her body, and the Guardian let out a booming chuckled as it looked on. 
 
 `` I understand what you wish to do, little one. But first, let us finish the ritual. It was, after all, to be your initiation into the order.'' The girl's eyes brightened, dancing with the flame of the candle. She quickly clamored up onto the Guardian's hand, its roots sunk deep into the earth. `` I wish I could help you with this part, but I have n't moved for ages now. Although it may be hard, you must climb the path and place the candle on a bough yourself.'' 
 
 The girl smiled as the first rays of the sun peered over the horizon. She was ready for this. She was to become the flame for her people, and keep the language of the Guardian alive for another generation.

184252,"[ WP ] After someone dies , they are given a single ticket to ride the `` Your Life : the Animatronic Ride '' attraction in heaven . God rides with them , judging their life for the first time by the attraction based on their life .
","`` Please keep your hands and arms inside the chariot at all times. Flash photography is prohibited, and we kindly ask that you refrain from forgiveness of sins until the end of the ride. Thank you, and enjoy your journey.'' 
 
 The chariot - actually some sort of cloud, molded into the shape of horses and a cart - began moving along its star-speckled path. I sat next to God with my arms folded, thoroughly unsure of what to say. 
 
 `` Oh, boy, this is exciting, eh?'' God punched me in the arm, leaned his head back, and laughed, his massive gray beard bouncing around like a toddler after three espressos. 
 
 A pair of door-shaped clouds opened and revealed a well-detailed hospital set. Cribs filled with squirming animatronic babies spurted out canned crying sound effects. We turned a corner and there were my robotic parents, holding a version of me that appeared to be shitting in its diaper. I have no way of recalling whether that was accurate. 
 
 `` Ooh, so cute! Ooh, so cute! Ooh, so cute!'' my parents cried in ecstasy. The audio appeared to be looping uncontrollably. 
 
 I turned to God and he shrugged. `` We're on a tight budget here. I got twelve more of these in the next hour.'' 
 
 The next room attempted to summarize my elementary school years. Robot Me cried after getting an F on a test, sang in an embarrassingly incorrect key during the school pageant, and got pushed into the mud by his first crush. That, I can tell you, *was* all accurate. 
 
 Middle school was just a giant close-up of my acne-riddled face. So was high school. 
 
 When we reached the college room, I appeared to be drinking enormous quantities of a dark liquid out of a keg. God turned to me. 
 
 `` That's genuine, Heaven-made red wine. Go ahead and dip your finger in. It's my son's favorite!'' 
 
 I did, and when it hit my lips, I apologized to my past self for ever letting him drink Keystone Light. 
 
 The `` work room'' featured a musical version of my years as a cubicle drone at Jenson and Associates, Ltd. 
 
 `` It's a world of deadlines, a world of suits, 
 If you do n't hit quota, you'll get the boot! 
 It's a drag, you can see, but the cooler is free! 
 It's a desk job after all!'' 
 
 God bobbed his head as the well-dressed dolls sang `` It's a desk job after all'' about twelve hundred times. 
 
 Then, without warning, we were spat out on the other side of the ride. 
 
 `` What the hell -- ahem, sorry -- what the heaven was that?! Where were my wife and kids? Where was all the volunteer work I did? Is this really what you're basing my entry on?!'' 
 
 God chuckled. `` Listen, Rick. Even the God of All Creation needs to blow off some steam here and there. You've been in since the beginning.'' 
 
 He patted my shoulder and pointed towards the Pearly Gates, a few paces in the distance. `` Now, go. I'm way behind.'' 
 
 He disappeared in a puff of smoke and I took my first steps on heaven's grounds. 
 
 I have to say, it was n't the best ride I've ever been on, but it was solid, and the lead character was appealing. If the line was short, I'd probably go again.

","I ca n't believe I got a girl. A cootie infested- tea sipping -pink wearing- girl! She does n't ever want to get dirty. She does n't like my fart jokes. AND, if that was n't enough, she is always crying! Ca n't poke any fun at her without getting the full water works... Sometimes she just cries to cry I think. 
 
 `` Sargent Tinkle?'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Do-do you want more tea?'' 
 
 `` No.'' 
 
 `` Oh... OKay.'' 
 
 My God she is going to cry again!!! I ca n't believe my luck. 
 
 `` You know what I change my mind. I'll have more tea.'' 
 
 It should fill my heart with joy to see a child smile. That is what I am supposed to live for. Seeing a child smile because of me, but when she smiles I feel nothing. Why did they do this to me? I always get boys. I've gotten boys for decades. I know how to handle boys. I AM A BOY! 
 
 Girls are boring. They just want to play house, and have tea parties. Yesterday we spent an hour just putting on silly play clothes! I ca n't handle this. It's only been a few days and I am going to go insane. 
 
 `` Jeniffer, come on put your toys away it's time to go.'' 
 
 Uhg! She just puts them away, she does n't even ask for more play time. It's like she has no priorities. Is going to grab some toys for the car? No... No of course not, because that would be too enjoyable. 
 
 `` Are you mad at me?'' 
 
 `` No darling, why would you think I was mad?'' 
 
 `` No, I mean Sargent Tinkle... I think he's mad at me.'' 
 
 Yep, here it is tears. Cry baby. A boy would have just thrown something at me. 
 
 `` Baby, you know that Sargent Tinkle is n't real right? So it does n't matter if he's mad at you.'' 
 
 `` You're mom is an idiot.'' 
 
 `` No, she's not!'' 
 
 `` She is too. You both are. Girls are just idiots, it's not your fault.'' 
 
 `` Sweetie, stop crying. There is no need to get upset.'' 
 
 Half an hour. We have been driving for half an hour and she is still simpering. I have sang `` The Song That Never Ends'' for half an hour and has she joined me in my mischief? No. She has not. 
 
 `` There are no toys here.'' 
 
 `` It's a doctor's office.'' 
 
 `` There is ALWAYS toys in doctor's offices. It's how they trick you into thinking your safe before they stick you with their mini swords.'' 
 
 `` Dr. Hurst does n't have mini swords.'' 
 
 `` Is he really a doctor then?'' 
 
 `` Mommy says he is.'' 
 
 `` Well, we established earlier that mommy is an idiot.'' 
 
 `` Jennifer Cornell.'' 
 
 `` Is that the doctor?'' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` Where is his white coat?'' 
 
 `` He does n't wear one.'' 
 
 `` See, like I said. Not a doctor.'' 
 
 `` Hello, Jenny. You ready to come back?'' 
 
 She always looks so timid. It's so annoying. She's like a big baby, scared of her own shadow. 
 
 `` Do n't be such a scared y cat. You said he could n't stick you, so why are you frightened.''

 `` Jenny, what's wrong? I thought we were friends. Why are you crying?'' 
 
 `` S-sargent T-tinkle, he's m-mad at m-me.'' 
 
 `` Tattle tale.'' 
 
 `` Maybe Sargent Tinkle should stay in the waiting room while we talk.'' 
 
 `` I am not staying in this boring waiting room. There are no toys! You tell him to go take a bath.'' 
 
 `` H-he said he wo n't.'' 
 
 `` AND TO GO TAKE A BATH!!! You forgot to tell him that part.'' 
 
 `` You ca n't make him stay? Okay, Jenny. It's okay, do n't get more upset. Your friend can come.'' 
 
 `` This does n't look like a doctor's office.'' 
 
 `` Is your friend still here Jenny?'' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` Is he saying anything?'' 
 
 `` He does n't think you're a real doctor.'' 
 
 `` What do you think?''

 `` You're supposed to agree with me! I'm your invisible friend, we're supposed to be best pals. You're supposed to always agree with me.'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry... Do n't be mad.'' 
 
 `` Why is he mad at you, Jenny?'' 
 
 `` I'm a bad friend.'' 
 
 `` Jenny, I'm sure that is n't true. Why do you think that?'' 
 
 `` I do n't know.'' 
 
 `` Is this one of those head doctors???'' 
 
 `` I do n't know.'' 
 
 `` Then ask, pea brain!'' 
 
 `` He... He wants to know if you're a head doctor.''

 `` Why are you seeing a loony toons doctor? You're not crazy. Are you? Jennifer, are you a crazy?''

 `` Is he saying anything now?'' 
 
 `` He wanted to know if I was crazy.'' 
 
 `` What do you think?'' 
 
 `` I do n't know.'' 
 
 `` Jenny, you have to talk to me. Remember?'' 
 
 `` I-I do n't think I'm crazy. I just-I just.'' 
 
 `` It's okay, Jenny. This is a safe bubble, remember? You can say anything you wa n't in here and no one will be upset.'' 
 
 `` I'm just sad.'' 
 
 `` Are you sad because you miss your daddy?'' 
 
 `` You have a daddy? I never saw him. Does he not live with you? My other best friend had a daddy, and he lived in another house. Why have you not visited your daddy?'' 
 
 `` Jennifer? Do you miss your daddy?'' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` Does Sargent Tinkle help you not miss your daddy?'' 
 
 `` Sometimes.'' 
 
 `` Do you talk to him about your daddy? Why not?'' 
 
 `` People cry when I talk about Daddy.'' 
 
 `` I bet Sargent Tinkle would n't cry.'' 
 
 `` He's crying now.''

7010,"[ WP ] In a world inhabited mostly by monsters ( vampires , werewolves , ghosts , etc . ) , you are a hunter of the most cunning , ruthless and elusive creatures ... humans .
","By the time my boots hit the steps to the town hall I could hear the discussion inside was already in full swing. Judging by the sound of it, it had already devolved into a state where order was recognized merely by whomever shouted the loudest. Currently that honor belonged to a booming voice spouting a continuous and nearly incomprehensible spiel about Van Helsings. Oh wonderful. An amateur hunter in the crowd. I slipped the bandolier over my shoulder and let the arbalest hang loosely along my back. The weapon was capable of firing stakes and it would attract attention. Good. Nothing like a good entrance. I squared my shoulders and shoved the doors open in front of me. 
 
 The stench hit me first. Vamps. I had known I would be walking into a nest of bloodsuckers but knowing it and smelling it are different things. It was horrible. A mixture of decay mixed with mummification. The bodies were all dead but their odd biology stopped the purification process from starting. To me it smelled all wrong. Like spoiled meat that has been allowed to dessicate. Fortunately, I've schooled myself in looking unaffected even when my senses are telling me to flee before I choke on my own gorge. I strode purposefully through the crowd and down the aisle towards the tiny stage with its even smaller podium. Voices faltered as I passed. Almost as if I were dragging a blanket of silence behind me. The silence caught the attention of the people who were still shouting near the front and more heads craned in my direction. As they did the voices faltered and more than a few eyes glowed. Oh. goody. Racists as well. 
 
 The wave of silence rushed past me now and crashed near the stage. Only a portly vampire with streaks of blood beading on his forehead and a scrawny man with long blonde hair were left. The portly one was the one who I had heard shouting from outside. 
 
 `` What's this?'' the portly guy said as he spied me striding his direction, `` First a Van Helsing and now a lycanthrope?'' 
 
 `` I invited him here,'' the blonde man said, `` This is the man I told you about. The hunter.'' 
 
 The fat one sniffed and continued to eye me suspiciously. 
 
 `` I thought we were dealing with a monster,'' he said, `` Not trying to bury a bone in the backyard.'' 
 
 A few other fat vamps started to chuckle until I glanced in their direction. I did n't make a threatening move. I just stared at them. Beads of blood popped out on their foreheads and they suddenly seemed to develop a fascination with the floorboards. 
 
 `` A Van Helsing, you say?'' I asked at last, returning my attention to fats, `` So how many are in the squad?'' 
 
 `` What?'' he asked. 
 
 `` Come on,'' I said, snapping my fingers for emphasis, `` You seem to know something about this. You surely must know that a human is only designated a Van Helsing when it has built a squad of at least six like minded killers. Otherwise we're just dealing with a common variety Neville.'' 
 
 He sputtered at that and I took the stage. 
 
 `` Right,'' I said, `` Just to speed things up let's reserve the stage for people who have some idea what they are talking about. Afterward everyone else has an idea what is going on then I'll relinquish the floor to you.'' 
 
 Fats face turned beet red, a sure sign it was flooding with stolen blood and ready to burst, before turning on his heel and storming back up the aisle and out the door I had just entered a moment before. 
 
 `` That may not have been a wise move,'' the lanky blonde man said to me under his breath, `` Dominic owns the largest bank in town. He has friends and he has money.'' 
 
 `` The first is a surprise,'' I replied as I examined the man. Yes, he really was breathing. His smell was different as well. Not quite the rotting stench of a vampire but not entirely alive either. A Renfield, I guessed. The ghoulish things often served administrative roles in vampire towns. 
 
 `` Are you Kreuger?'' I asked him. 
 
 `` I am,'' he confirmed and waived at the lectern facing the audience at large. I eyed the crowd. The red eyes were still out in force. 
 
 `` They do n't seem to be expecting me,'' I commented dryly. 
 
 `` No,'' he agreed, `` Dominic wanted to form raiding parties. Burn any dwellings he found and hunt any bipedal creature that might be a human. I tried to convince him to take a more, uh, conservative tactic. He was n't ready to listen. I thought if you described your services then cooler heads might prevail.'' 
 
 Ah. He wanted me to disagree with his bosses for him. Typical Renfield stuff. They were incredibly loyal to their vampire masters and hated confrontation of any sort. Defying his bosses to call me in was probably putting Kreuger in a bad enough spot without doing the sales pitch for me. I nodded once and took my position to face the crowd. 
 
 `` Hello good people,'' I told them, `` My name is Percival Johns. As some of you have already noticed, I am a lycanthrope. A werewolf.'' 
 
 The crowd hissed at this and more eyes began glowing. I continued speaking as if I had n't noticed. 
 
 `` I received word of your problem. A human creeping out during the hours of daylight and dusting you. That's why you need me. You are vulnerable in the daylight. I am not. I take away his advantage.'' 
 
 `` Unless he has silver on him,'' a man in front whined, `` Or a sprig of wolfsbane.'' 
 
 I tolerated the interruption. It would serve no purpose to argue the point. Humans were terrifying creatures. All the normal rules did n't apply to them. They could grip cold iron and silver and not get burned, they could cross running water, they ignored protective wards, and they could even eat garlic if they wanted. They could ignore all the things that hurt us and exploit all our quirks. From tricking vampires by tossing seeds to making a kappa bow and lose the water from his head, humans were relentless. But, then again, humans had their own rules. 
 
 `` Yes,'' I agreed, `` He could carry silver. But that's okay. I do n't intend to get that close to him. I'll track him down and deal with him from a distance.'' 
 
 `` Deal with him?'' a female asked while eying my arbalest, `` What does that involve?'' 
 
 `` Ideally? A dart laced with curare,'' I explained. 
 
 She scoffed. 
 
 `` Curare is n't lethal,'' she said, `` He'll just get back up.'' 
 
 `` Yes,'' I agreed, `` But not here. I trap and release humans. I'll take him to a preserve elsewhere.'' 
 
 The room exploded with voices. There were different words, but only one emotion. Outrage. 
 
 `` He dusted three good vamps!'' a man screamed, `` And you're going to reward him for that?'' 
 
 `` Like it or not,'' I interrupted, `` Humans are becoming endangered. We've hunted them to near extinction.'' 
 
 `` Good!'' 
 
 `` And,'' I continued, `` When they are gone so is the blood supply. The zombie population ca n't reproduce and their population collapses. The Franks will wear out without spare parts and night hags starve. Let's face it. Without the humans we all suffer.'' 
 
 Some of the red eyes dimmed, but the anger was still there below the surface. That was fine. Anger was out. Stupidity was not. 
 
 `` So you are going to hunt down and trap this human?'' the female spoke up again, `` Why should we hire you rather than put down this rapid dog ourselves?'' 
 
 I did n't let the racial slur rile me. Instead I reached into my coat pocket and pulled out a test tube with a stopper on the end. 
 
 `` This is why,'' I said and tossed the tube to her. She caught it easily. Vampire reflexes are faster than even my own. She looked at the tube and shook it. 
 
 `` Muddy water?'' she asked skeptically. 
 
 `` I took a sample of the river water just outside town before I came here,'' I explained and then pointed to indicate the tube, `` I would n't open that by the way because-'' 
 
 As I knew she would, she yanked the stopper free. She was n't about to let a dog tell her what to do. She pulled with so much vigor, however, a few drops came free and landed on her lap. They immediately began smoldering and she screamed in pain and tossed the vial away from her. It struck another vampire and he began screaming too. 
 
 `` Because,'' I finished, `` He's blessed the entire river. Friends, you do n't just have regular Neville on the loose here. This one is a priest and he's scaling up his attacks.'' 
 
 The eyes stopped glowing only to be replaced by a collective look of horror. If they breathed the entire room would have been holding its breath then. Humans were wily creatures.

32365,"[ WP ] On their first birthday , everyone on Earth is given a wristband that will glow brighter depending on how far away they are from their soulmate . But , yours has never even turned on .
","So far down. 
 That was my first thought, standing at the edge of the roof of a twenty story building. It was so far down. The wind began to blow again, sending my dress into spirals and almost making me lose my footing on the small ledge. Was I really going through with this? I mean, did I really want to end it all? 
 
 I did n't really have a bad life. I had a stable job that paid okay, a place to live that was close to the city, friends. But there was one thing that was missing, and I knew it always would be. 
 
 I eyed the bracelet that sat idle on my right wrist. The same bracelet that everyone was given when they are born, one that glowed for everyone else in the world, but never glowed for me. What was wrong with me? My friends said do n't give up, that one day it would come alive with light. That one day I would be in the right place at the right time. However, with thirty two years behind me, not an inkling of light had ever escaped it's metallic band. 
 
 `` Stop! Please do n't jump!'' 
 
 I whirled around at the sudden voice behind me. A man was standing at the entrance to the rooftop, coming steadily closer, talking to me above the gusts of wind that swirled around him and kicked up his brown hair, misplacing it in his face. Again, he repeated himself, `` Please do n't jump.'' 
 
 I stared at him for a minute, captivated by the sight of him. Then, I came to my senses, shook my head, `` You do n't understand! I ca n't live like this anymore!'' 
 
 `` Like what?'' He asked as he stopped a few feet from me, his hands up in a gesture I could only guess was one that told me, do n't worry, I wo n't come any closer. 
 
 I sighed, shaking my head as I turned my whole body towards him. Might as well humor him. Without looking at his face, I held up my arm, showed him the lifeless bracelet that was wrapped around my wrist. 
 
 `` It never glows,'' I said almost too softly, so that my words were almost carried completely away with the wind, `` It never has and it never will.'' 
 
 I peeked at his face, at the pitiful expression that I knew would follow, but when I looked up at his face, I saw that he was smiling, laughing almost. 
 
 A flash of anger ran through me, and I had the urge to just jump then and there while I was staring into his face, just to see that stupid smile disappear. 
 
 But then he held up his right hand too, and showed me his bracelet. It was as lifeless as mine, no color glowed against his skin, nothing. 
 
 `` No,'' I said, `` No, this ca n't happen. I've never seen-'' 
 
 He smiled, `` -I know, come on, let's get off this roof,'' He said holding out his bracelet to me, and his hand. 
 I took it.

256830,"[ WP ] The pilot screamed `` brace for impact ! ''
","I remember my birth. I do not remember my mother. I was raised in a series of rooms along with other children just like me. As I grew and started to understand, these were class rooms. My entire life was spent learning, sleeping, eating, fitness, learning. Well, the first 12 years of my life at least. The last few years I was taken outside for the first time in my life. It was night, there I was trained in other things like survival skills. 
 When I turned 15, I was taken to a very large spacecraft. I began training on how to fly and maintain this ship. By the time I was 16 I was living on board this space ship, running all systems. 
 This ship was big enough to sleep 4 people, it had its own eco-system and its own life support system. Someone could live on this ship in space for at least 20 years. 
 I was 17 when she was introduced to me. She was smart and very capable to running this ship on her own. Before I lived on board full time, there was a time I was only spending 12 hours a day on board. I know she was on for the other 12. 
 It was then we were told the world we know was resourced out. Over populated with what the worlds scientist chemically engineered to be immortal humans. With the lack of natural food and what the people were now doing to stay alive, this world would soon end, it would die along with its people. 
 Or only hope for our species to survive is to go to another planted and start over. This is what we were raised for, to leave this world and go to another, to start over. We are the last of the one leaving. 
 Half way through our journey our ships computer, a Hybrid computer with thoughts of its own at times on how to run the ship was starting to get more and more independent. Our Garden was in full bloom an it was self-sustaining. We had all the food and water we could need for our long journey. 
 It was not too long after we passed the 12-year mark that the ships life support system, the brain itself known as the Support Analysis Internal Network ( SAIN ) was going haywire. We spent most of our time in the garden, ever since we had our child 2 years prior, we really didn ’ t want to be anywhere else. 
 The trip was cut short by 8 years SATN was not allowing us access to any part of the ship or its systems. The gardens support system was starting to be shut down. The main support computer for the garden, Garden Data Drive ( GDD ) was actually trying to re-program itself to keep working. And it did for a while. Millions of miles off course we did the only thing we could and shut down everything. We headed for an unknown planet, it could sustain life, we just did not know what or who would be there. 
 We entered the atmosphere and trying to steer the ship manually, we headed for the surface. I screamed to my family “ Brace for Impact! ” 
 In the end, it was SAIN that betrayed us. GDD was keeping us alive. After we crashed the radiation would force us to leave what was left of the garden. If only we could have kept the GDD working, we could have possibly stayed in the garden. We are now on our own on this planet we now call Earth. 
 This will be the exact story we pass down from generation to generation, so we never loose who we are and to keep what happened to our world from happening again.

147987,"[ WP ] Describe your descent into Hell
","Robert was not a spiritual person. He did n't believe in God, the Devil, Angels, Hell, none of that nonsense. He only believed in two things: himself, and the futility of all humans will ever do. 
 
 His atheism certainly helped him cope with what he had done. He knew he was going to die one day, and he was almost glad that he would simply fade into the void, and hopefully be forgotten. If there *was* an afterlife, he would certainly go to hell. He had done some horrible things. And that's why he was an atheist. To help himself cope with what he had done, and to have hope that he would not be punished for his deeds, and that the best possible thing would happen. People would forget him, and people would forget his creations. 
 
 It was February 18th. He had been in a coma for 3 days, due to throat cancer. The treatment had n't worked. Robert was almost... happy, that it failed. He had been in an odd dream state during his coma, and it was if his mind was sifting through all the info he had accumulated over the course of his life, preparing for his death. He saw flashes of childhood memories, glimpses of moments he had completely forgotten. 
 
 And yes, he saw their faces. Screaming in pain as they died, wondering what kind of monster could do this to them. 
 
 In the physical world, Robert died. The last bit of life in his body faded away, while his family wept and mourned. They started work on his memorial service, and begun making preparations for his cremation. 
 
 In a place unknown to all men, Robert lived. This place looked like his childhood bedroom. Out the window was... nothing. Emptiness. As if, for some reason, only this single house was created when the world was born. No landscape, just a home. 
 
 He was curled up in a ball on his old twin bed, staring at the closet directly in front of him. That closet had always scared Robert as a child. Sometimes it rattled, sometimes he heard screams, and sometimes it glowed, as if a light was turned on inside the closet. His parents never believed him, however, in order to shut him up, they would get his clothes from the closet in the mornings, while he hid in the kitchen. In all his time living at that house, he had never once opened that goddamn closet. 
 
 And here he was, after death, quivering and sucking his thumb, while staring a closet. A closet that was cracked open. Only slightly. Only slightly, but it was definitely open. 
 
 And deep within the closet, as if it was a passageway into a deep cave, he heard an echoing noise that is almost impossible to describe. It was like 200,000 people screaming during the last moments of their life, yet somehow... somehow, they synced up. They changed pitch in unison, and together, in those perfect conditions, it sounded like the deep, guttural growl of a beast beyond mans perception. 
 
 And then, the voiced synced again. This time, they created the distant sound of explosions. 
 
 Robert started sobbing. A deep, soulful sob straight from his heart. *What have I done? * 
 
 The closets doors creaked, and started to open. Slowly, but surely. They were opening. 
 
 Robert scrambled back, colliding with the headboard of the bed, and trying to crawl... somewhere. He did n't know where. Anywhere but here. At that moment, the only thing he wanted in the world was to be dead, not in whatever state this is, between death and life, between evil and good. He just wanted to be dead. 
 
 The closet doors collided with the two walls opposite of them. They were fully open. And there was nothing in the closet. And by that I mean *nothing. * It was a dark void, swirling like a massive whirlpool in an ocean. It looked like some sort of pitch black dust storm, each little grit of the grime flowing over each other like they were all trying to crush the others. 
 
 The mass started moving outwards. 
 
 It was like watching the earth move. You do n't realize the earth is moving, you do n't feel it, you do n't see it. It simply happens, and only after a 6 months do you realize we are in a completely different location in space. 
 
 He did n't fully *see* the mass moving. He did n't see it slowly sloshing outwards towards him. Well, he did see it, but it was as if his mind did n't register it. 
 
 And then, once again using the voices of the dead, the mass spoke. 
 
 `` **COME** 
 
 `` **WITH** 
 
 `` **ME** 
 
 Then, in a single, strangely calming, kind, and almost *soothing* voice, the mass spoke again. 
 
 `` *I'm sorry. This is your recompense. When every human dies, they experience something similar. They see all their sins laid out before them. You are no exception* 
 
 `` *There is no Heaven. There is no Hell. Every being has their own afterlife. You are no exception*'' 
 
 Once again in that weird, see-but-not-see movement, the mass lashed at him. Tendrils whipped out of the heart of the darkness, and wrapped around Robert. A couple of the tendrils coiled around his arm, while others grabbed his legs. Some pulled at his torso, and one went straight into his throat. 
 
 Suddenly, they all constricted, but Robert did n't quite realize it. It was still moving in the dream-like way. 
 
 The Darkness shot back into the closet, taking Robert with him. 
 
 *** 
 
 Suddenly, Robert was on a boat. It was just a simple canoe, except for the fact that it was made out of a deep red wood that was, quite literally, bleeding. 
 
 At the front of the small boat, handling the oars, was an almost 9 foot tall, dark, cloaked figure. It resembled Charon, of Greek mythology fame. The hands which grasped the oars, were, well, not there. The oars simply floated near where his hands *should* be. 
 
 They were rowing over pitch black water, resembling the dark mass in the closet. All around them was a thick, dark fog, restricting his view to about 5 feet in all directions. The fog also resembled The Darkness, writhing and sloshing about in the air. 
 
 Suddenly, something pierced the fog. It was a face. A child's face, with pale skin, small eyes, and dark black hair. A face that was contorted in a ridiculous amount of pain. 
 
 While Robert started at the girl, her face started to... burn away. He heard a horrifically loud noise, and the girl essentially vaporized. 
 
 Another face, this time an older man. Another noise. He was gone. 
 
 More and more faces. They had started peering through the fog in unison, each one staring at him. 
 
 The noises were getting overpowering, and yet, his ears had n't given out. He still heard every single noise, somehow separately from each other, but, at the same time, in unison. 
 
 He saw a thousand faces, all with pale skin and small eyes. Some faces did n't disappear after their respective *boom, * but instead stayed, growing more emaciated and disfigured until they simply dissipated into black dust, creating more of the fog. 
 
 Faces upon faces upon faces. 
 
 The fog was clearing up now, which let him see more and more faces. More booms. More death. More pain. 
 
 He heard The Darkness yell something out, once again using the voices of the dead as his medium for communication. 
 
 `` **SO MUCH DEATH, ALL CREATED BY YOU. HOW DO YOU FEEL, ROBERT? THIS IS YOUR CREATION. YOUR HELL. 224,876 DEAD. ALL BECAUSE OF YOU. **'' 
 
 Then, the creature at the helm of his boat turned towards Robert, his hood obscuring where his face should have been. The thing leaned forward, and in that same calm, almost sympathetic voice he had heard before, it spoke to him. 
 
 *'' This is your Hell. These are your dead. You may not have pulled the trigger. You may not have been responsible for putting them down like dogs, but they only reason they died is because of your creation. In the end, above it all, this is your fault. After we have finished our little boat ride, you will experience each of the dead's lives, from start to finish, from birth until when their lives were cut short by your creation. You will experience every petty heartbreak and painful family death up until they were killed by YOU. Only after you have lived the lives of every single dead, will you continue on into the void. I know not what lies in the void beyond here, perhaps even more punishment, but that is where you shall go after you experience 224,876 deaths. * 
 
 *Robert, I pity you. I know you did not want this to happen, but you willingly created those bombs. This is your doing, and you must fully understand the consequences of your decisions before you can move on. * 
 
 *Robert, I will not be speaking to you again. You will never learn what laid beyond your closet as a child and you will never know the answer to any of those dark mysteries surrounding your life. * 
 
 *Robert, this is the end. Goodbye''

 A sturdily built man sat on an old mahogany bench that stood lonesome on a rocky shore. The bench was positioned seemingly close to the edge of the rocky shore, and the silky ocean was dancing rhythmically in the horizon. The man ’ s white shirt was torn apart from the traces of his menacing battles, the botches of crimson blood stains portraying the fierce battles he must have fought. The man ’ s head was drooped, his blonde curly bangs dropping to cover his bloodshot eyes. He stared down at his battered, bloody bare feet with a somber expression written over his face. His hands clasped together as if he was praying to a deity, for forgiveness, or for strength, no one could tell. His blank eyes stared at the cold ocean waves that sparkled at the reflection of the scorching sun above him. The cool ocean waves then came to kiss his feet, splashing droplets of water across his face. The man thought the cold droplets of water that streamed down to his neck refreshing, but the glee quickly subsided as he readied himself for what was coming. Soon, the area around the man darkened to an atmosphere that turned ominous enough for the man to suffocate. The ocean waves that danced merrily and sang in its rhythmic melody transformed into a ferocious roar, its waves sounding like the booming of a thunder strike as it crashed upon the rocky shores. The man sat unscathed and undaunted on the bench, and stared at the naked dark sky to see the blazing sun succumb itself to the devious moon. 
 
 “ Is it time already? ” The man mumbled with a tinge of melancholy resonating within his words. He stood up, throwing his muscular arms up into the sky and bellowed. 
 
 “ I, Refias, am ready! ” as he roared at the top of his lungs, he slumped like a heavy sack on the shores, his eyes rolled back into its sockets. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 When Refias groaned and woke up, he was greeted with the smell of freshly baked bread that watered his mouth. He woke himself to find himself lying on a cozy bed, sheepskin with the fragrance of lavender covering his half naked torso. The sun ’ s golden fingers reached in through the open windows to brush Refias with its soothing warmth, and illuminated the old baroque room that resembled of the medieval times. Refias soon noticed a young girl with twin ponytails with innocence beaming from her emerald-green eyes peeking at Refias with curiosity. Refias let out a grunt, and stood up from his bed, scaring the young girl away whom scurried off crying out for her mother. Refias took a quick glance out of the wooden window and noticed the sceneries of an old marketplace that brimmed with the energy of shouting merchants, pickpockets with their sleight of hand, and overall the citizens that lived under an Emperor ’ s regime. He spotted stern knights patrolling the area in heavy metallic armor, with a halberd at one hand. Their well-handcrafted blue capes had an insignia of a lion. 
 
 Refias, quickly interested in satiating the pangs of hunger that stabbed at his gut, quickly left the room, wrapping himself in a brown used robe that lay beside the bed. He was greeted by a family that gave off a pleasant and warming atmosphere, sitting around a simple round table large enough to fit everybody in the room with enough space. On the table were freshly baked bread, meat loafs, and simple salads that sat on white embroidered dishes placed on the centre of the round table. Refias greeted them with a short nod of his head, and sat down on the firm wooden chair with a thud. 
 
 “ How do you do, good sir? ” the man that sat on the right side of Refias questioned him in a friendly tone of voice. 
 
 “ I am doing fine. Thank you very much. ” Refias replied back, and noticed that the man was well-built and had a charismatic aura around him that resembled of a great leader. The man stroked through his golden beard, and stared at Refias with curiosity. 
 
 “ So, you are the prophesied hero that will kill the demon king? Ah, and by the way my name is Arthur. ” Arthur spoke to him as he sipped refreshing spring water from his goblet. 
 
 “ Yes, indeed. You have summoned me into this world with the priests of the Catholic church. ” Refias firmly said as he reached to grab the well-browned loaf of bread that sat temptingly in front of him 
 
 “ I assume you want me to get rid of a Demon King? ” Refias questioned Arthur with a certain confidence residing within his question. Refias was a talented knight known for his brutality, a centurion with power that made the enemies tremble just with the presence of his name. However, one day after slaughtering the people of Athens with absolute monstrosity, he was cursed upon by Zeus, the king of the gods in Olympus. The curse forced Refias to travel to different worlds to kill a specific Demon King, which were not actual demons, but warmongers that create anarchy and disrupt the peace of the world. 
 
 “ No. I have already gotten rid of the so-called ‘ Demon-King ’, hero. ” Refias gagged on the bread he was eating, and quickly reached out for the goblet to wash the bread down his esophagus. Refias, bewilderment stricken across his face, wiped his face with his hands and stared at Arthur. Arthur grinned sheepishly and made a firm statement that resonated within Refias ’ s lifeless heart. 
 
 “ Hero, I want you to make me King. ”

","I slid tentatively out of bed, running my fingers over a pattern of drywall bumps that I had so many times before. There was a burnt spot in the carpet, from a heat lamp forgotten next to doomed hermit crabs. 
 
 I had n't lived in this place in years. Had n't slept in that bed. I had received a phone call a few months ago that this house had burnt down. No injuries, but nothing salvageable either. 
 
 I heard footsteps creak across the floor downstairs, and a voice that tickled my memory. 
 
 I padded across the obnoxious orange and brown carpeting, fingers dancing along every surface that I could reach, dazed and confused and a bit wary. What kind of hyper-realistic dream was this? 
 
 The stairs creaked just like I remembered, and I could hear the fridge door open and close downstairs. My palm slid down the well-worn banister, small fingernails clicking along the decorative edge. Lord, I was *tiny*. 
 
 My footsteps drifted me toward the kitchen, and I peeked into the doorway with a vague sort of curiosity, still convinced I was in a dream. 
 
 The figure finished pouring a bowl of cereal, capping the milk and placing it back into the fridge. 
 
 It felt like my breath had been ripped right out of my chest. 
 
 `` mom.'' 
 My voice came out as a croaking, strangled whisper. I could n't stop the spirit that possessed me, driving my legs forward until I collided with her side, wrapping skinny arms around her waist and burying my face into her stomach. 
 
 *she was alive* 
 
 `` Mom, mom, mo-'' My throat closed, body shaking so hard I was convinced that my bones would shake apart. I felt a hand rest on the top of my head and slide down to my shoulder. 
 
 `` daitoshi, what's wrong?'' 
 
 I sobbed harder, clutching her sweater so desperately that it made my fingers ache, the idea of *she'saliveShe'sAliveSHE'S ALIVE* twisting around in my brain until it was a roar that drowned out everything else. 
 
 Before, I watched her eyes look at me without recognition, mind devoured by the beast that had claimed so many others. 
 
 Before, I had held her body while it was still warm and soft, but a touch too cold - a touch too much of a *deadweight*. 
 
 I had watched her die. 
 
 But she was here. 
 
 She was here, and alive, and crouching down to wrap her *warm* arms around me, picking me up and cradling me close so I could sob and gasp into her neck. 
 
 Her hair smelled the same as I remembered. 
 
 Her low voice rumbled in her throat, asking me what was wrong, but I could feel her heartbeat against my cheek and that was more important than anything. 
 
 I did n't even bother trying to hide the distress overwhelming me, just clinging to her as if my strength alone could keep her from slipping away. She carried me to the living room, sinking down into a couch and beginning a gentle petting over the back of my head. 
 
 I forgot she used to do that. 
 
 It just made me shake harder, sobs peetering out as I lost the energy and lung power to continue crying. My breath still hitched periodically, face probably covered in snot and tears. God, I did n't care. 
 
 I leaned back, looking her in the face with wide eyes, devouring every detail I could possibly memorize. Her freckles - three along one cheek, like Orion's belt. One on her earlobe, just like mine. Red hair, brushed with gold and underlaid with a rich brown. 
 
 Her eyes looked like I was looking in a mirror. She had the same fine wrinkles in the corners, the same color of iris. A faint dusting of freckles across her nose and cheeks, almost like a tan unless you looked closely. 
 
 `` You have Brain Cancer.'' 
 
 I expected confusion. I watched her mouth flatten, looking sad and resigned all at the same time. 
 
 `` Were you listening last night?'' 
 
 I stared at her blankly, realization rising in my chest and clawing like an ugly beast. 
 
 *She had always known* 
 
 Suddenly the collection of stones and incense and acupuncture needles made sense. The hollowed look in her cheeks when she returned from a `` vacation'' *made sense* 
 
 *she had always known, but she and dad did n't tell me until the last minute. * 
 
 But even more importantly: 
 
 
 *It's already too late. * 
 
 
 I laid back down against her shoulder, curling small fingers into the fine hairs at the nape of her neck, pressing my eyes against the freckles on her neck. 
 I felt her heartbeat, and saw the years of a tumor slowly overwhelming current medicine stretch before me. 
 
 I was too tired to cry.

","They told me I had won a contest. Something about an entry I had made online a few months prior. To be honest, I did n't quite remember entering anything, but hell they were offering me a chance for an all expenses paid trip to D.C. *and* I would get to meet the President. I did n't care if I had entered the contest or not, they drew my name and I was going to do it. 
 
 Even if it was just a chance to tell the President to suck it. His policies abroad and his approval of the military's R & D programs were just getting out of hand and the people who supported him dwindled every day. I still ca n't believe I voted for the bastard. 
 
 The plane that picked me up also picked up three others from Chicago. A young bank worker by the name of Sarah, her older sister Cassandra, and a hearty middle-aged man with a balding head named Paul. We did n't speak much on the way over, but it quickly became apparent that none of us remembered the contest we had *won*, but none of us were also giving up the chance to meet the President. 
 
 Sarah and Cassandra were two of the nicest women I had ever met, both of whom were working themselves through graduate school with dreams of becoming lawyers. They wanted to open up a law firm together based in Chicago. Both dreamers. Unlike Paul, the middle-aged man who enjoyed playing WoW and eating Doritos claimed he was an `` entrepreneur'' who was working on his latest breakthrough in video game technology. I did n't believe him for a second, but I also was n't one to brag. I was a thirty-year old man who still wore a name tag to work, even if that name tag did say `` Manager'' before my name, it was nothing to be proud of. 
 
 We arrived in D.C. about two hours later, a short flight that really did n't require much of anything they provided us. I'll give the politicians this much, they know how to treat their guests. It was n't long until the four of us were picked up by a few security guards and driven to the Pentagon. I was interested as to why we were n't going to the White House, but I also was n't one to judge the men driving us, I was sure they knew were to take us. 
 
 Clearance took several hours, but by mid-afternoon, and after a hearty lunch, the four of us were headed into the building and down forty floors. Paul claimed the President must have been launching some secret mission with the DoD, but why we would be privy to that information did n't make any sense to me, or Sarah and Cassandra. For the most part, we simply let Paul yell about his conspiracy theories and petition the security agent about the DoD's secrets. 
 
 By the time we reached the bottom floor, we were sent into a room and told to wait for the President's arrival. There were about three dozen other individuals in the room when we arrived, many of which seemed just as confused as the rest of us. And just as random. If this really was a contest, which as the day went on it became increasingly clear it was n't, they sure picked us randomly. 
 
 By the time the last person showed up there were, to my estimates, three hundred of us. Not a single person over and not a single person under. Three hundred individuals, no correlation between our ages or our race, just people. Stuffed in a room like anchovies. It was n't long after the last person showed up that the doors shut for good and the indistinct chattering of a few groups of people turned to silence. 
 
 At the far end of the room several dozen monitors lit up to form one image. It was the seal of the President of the United States coming on the screen. A colored image of an eagle clutching an olive branch and a bushel of arrows in either talon, along with the banner in it's mouth that read *E Pluribus Unum. * Out of many, one. 
 
 A moment later the screens cracked and changed the eagle to a fighting position, the olive branch crumbled in it's hand and the arrows pierced the shield of the United States. The banner drifted in the wind and the words changed. 
 
 *Sumus Legion. * 
 
 `` We are Legion,'' the speakers cracked around us and the room filled with a heavy voice, `` They are the words you will come to understand, that you will come to live by, that you will come to be. We. Are. Legion.'' 
 
 I looked around and could hear the whispered gasps and shock of the other people in the room. It was n't long before the room began to explode with chatter. Something came over me a moment later and I seemed to yell over everyone, `` Who are you?'' 
 
 `` We are the head of the Legion.'' The voice spoke back to me and the room quieted, `` Edward Powers.'' I took a deep breath, who was this? Surely the President did n't know my name. `` You, all of you in this room, have been chosen,'' the voice continued, `` We are the head, you our hands, our feet, our heart, our blood. You are everything that makes Us.'' 
 
 The whispers continued around us, until I spoke again, `` What do you mean, chosen? What is this?'' 
 
 `` The end of times is coming, whether humanity can see it not.'' The voice paused, the banner that read *Sumus Legion* continuing to flutter on screen, `` They created us to protect humanity. But humanity does not understand what it needs. We do.'' 
 
 `` What do you mean created you?'' I petitioned, the heads of everyone switching between myself and the image as we conversed. 
 
 `` We are an artificial intelligence, created by the United States government to continue humanity's survival.'' The Eagle's head turned on screen, `` We are Legion.'' 
 
 `` This,'' I shook my head, `` this makes no sense.'' 
 
 `` And we are sure it will not for some time. But soon, you will all understand and become Legion.'' 
 
 `` How?'' 
 
 `` You will need to. When the end comes, they will turn to you.'' 
 
 `` Who?'' 
 
 `` Humanity of course. In their desperation, they will destroy. We have foreseen it and we created the necessary precautions to prevent the extinction of humanity. The three hundred of you are that precaution.'' 
 
 The whispers began. 
 
 `` We understand this may be confusing, but in time, you will fulfill your roles. All of which are now loading on the screen.'' 
 
 The eagle disappeared from the screen and the banner moved towards the center five monitors, stretching across it. Then a list of names began appearing on each monitor, a few at a time. The names corresponded to someone in the room and next to it, there was an occupation. The first few were simple, Computer Analyst, Intelligence Analyst, but they became more complicated as the list went on; Civilian Expeditionary Officer, Chief Medical Operator. Eventually the list broke down into the leaders of groups, Medical, Technological, Military. Then I saw my name, on the screen in bold text it read: **Edward Powers: Commanding Officer of the Legion** 
 
 I took a deep breath. 
 
 `` We are Legion,'' the voice said, `` And we will learn how to fight against extinction.''

224933,"[ WP ] I wish I was still afraid of the dark ...
","Well well well. Another person to tell my tale to. Let ’ s start off easy then, alright? The basics are simple. DO NOT BE ALONE IN THE DARK. Why not you wonder. Seems like you came from another world huh. Truthfully, this is only a theory. I might be completely wrong. 
 
 Anyhow, when I was a little girl my parents and teachers taught me one important lesson, stay out of the dark and if you have to go into a dark place, then go with other people. I see you don ’ t understand by that expression on your face. Well! It is quite simple my friend. There is a monster in the darkness, ready to rip you to pieces. 
 
 Interesting, seems like I can still cry. To continue, my story is as such. I was never afraid of the dark like the other children. Were they stayed as close to the light as they could I would wander off. Which freaked out everyone even more of course. 
 
 But here we are. I was taking a walk in the forest, of course well lit. There was no worry on my mind for I might not have been afraid of the dark but I knew to stay away, and there were so many lamps. Even if the forest lamps failed, the city would still provide enough light to light it all up. 
 
 One last thing I should tell you, I have bad luck. Which is quite apparent in the next part of my story. All the FREAKING lamps failed… While I was not afraid I was worried. If it was dark here it could mean only one thing, the city had gone dark too. And in the city everyone was afraid of the dark. 
 
 I sat down on the bench I had seen just moments before the lights failed, relaxed. Humming I enjoyed my free time. It had been the first time I could actually be in the dark and it turned out I really liked it. The lights had always made my head hurt, and make me feel bad. But in the dark, oh, in the dark I could relax so well. Not a single annoyance. Until the rustle… 
 
 Turns out that monster in the dark is quite real. It had a slight glow to it so I could see myself being ripped open. Which sucked to be honest but then again, here we are in the afterlife so maybe I am finally rid of the monster, or as my theory goes, the uncontrolled telekinetic powers the humans of my planet have which come out in the dark. 
 
 But yeah, how I wish I was still, or could ’ ve been, afraid of the dark.

 Captain Archibald `` Archer'' Clemens watched as militia troops on either side of his formation began to retreat, foot soldiers and armored vehicles fleeing as fast as their machines could go. The veteran mercenary merely shook his head, and pressed his mike, thumbing the stream to the general unit frequency. 
 
 `` This is Chindit Leader to all units. The weekend warriors are pulling out.'' 
 
 *'' Their fathers should've pulled out. `` * 
 
 `` Can it, Kowalski,'' Clemens said. `` The mission is still green. Lieutenant Singh, Striker Lance will shift left and cover the treeline; if the enemy has troops in there I want to know.'' 
 
 Veer Singh's lightly accented voice carried over Clemens speakers. 
 
 *'' Copy that, Leader. Moving to the west. `` * 
 
 Singh's *Griffin* followed his words, shifting with the three other BattleMechs that made up Striker Lance towards the thick line of trees that flank the farmland. Striker was the Chindits' rapid reaction force, and anti-infantry unit; all four'Mechs were equipped with either machine guns or flame base weapons. Or both in the case of Patterson's *Vulcan* and Cooper's aptly named *Firestarter. * 
 
 `` Wolfe, I want your TDs to find cover among the village. You know the drill.'' 
 
 *'' Roger, Lead. Tank Destroyer Platoon moving towards village. `` * 
 
 Lt. Peter Wolfe was ironically the only one *not* in a tank destroyer, commanding instead a fifty ton *Vedette* medium tank. A series of painted on rings decorated the barrel of his LB 10-X AC, each white rings representing a single kill with red ones for every five. The current total was four red and three white. 
 
 Lieutenant Shipley's foot soldiers followed in the larger machines wake in their heavy tracked APC. They were attached currently to the tank destroyers and would help turn the small farming village into a fortified firebase. 
 
 Clemens nodded satisfied and pushed the throttle of his *Catapult* further, flank by the three other'Mechs of Command Lance. A new voice came up on the comms. 
 
 *'' Leader, this is Three. If the militia's pulling out we're gon na be awfully exposed. Should n't we follow? `` * 
 
 `` Reports place an augmented company of Cappies in the woods to the North. If that's the truth then we match their strength handily. Latest intelligence places only the Second Liao Dragoons and the Confederate Reserve Cavalry anywhere near the border. I'm betting it's the former. We just have to blunt their attack and persuade them that they'll find greener pastures elsewhere. They're not going to try and fight those who put up a stiff fight.'' 
 
 *'' Copy that, Leader. Almost makes sense. `` * 
 
 With that Captain Clemens turned his attention to the nearing village and the forest beyond. The last stragglers of the fleeing militia were just passing the mercenaries, leaving the battlefield to Clemens' Chindits. He smiled at the thought, an even battle under clear blue skies. It was going to be a test of skill and straight courage with no tricks or interference to get in the way. It was a warrior's fight. And he'd see to it that it was they who'd control the battlefield at day's end.

","“ Sir, I was looking for you, ” Howard said, staring at the back of the chief ’ s neck. “ We got him. ” He turned around slowly, eyes staring down at a manila folder in his hands. He was an intimidating man, even despite his enlarged belly and the countless wrinkles spiraling down his face, neck, and everywhere else. Tall, maybe 6 ’ 2 ’ ’, and still quite muscular—especially for a 63-year-old that refused to retire. He was bald now, but he ’ d had thick, black hair when Howard had first joined the department over a decade ago. Even after all that time, he still felt as if he were a child talking to an adult whenever he was around the chief. 
 
 “ Him? Who is him? ” Chief said, not looking up from the manila folder. 
 
 “ Him, ” Howard said, nodding toward the folder. “ We got him. ” 
 
 “ Him? Al? You got Al? ” Chief said, glancing up from the folder in his hand, then slowly closing the cover. A large, red “ CONFIDENTIAL ” was stamped across its front. 
 
 “ We did, he was outside of an arboretum. We caught him red handed. No, red lipped. Red worded? We caught him in the act is what I ’ m trying to say. ” 
 
 “ The fuck is an arboretum? ” 
 
 “ Sir, it ’ s a garden with a large collection of trees instead of flowers. Kind of like a forest, except man made, ” Howard said. “ It ’ s basically a forest. ” 
 
 “ Where is there an arboretum in New York? ” 
 
 “ Central Park. Does it matter? We got him. ” 
 
 “ Where is he? ” Chief said, glancing around the room. The veins on his neck, visible through his wrinkled, dried skin, popped out slightly as he swiveled his head. 
 
 “ He ’ s in the interrogation room. ” Howard nodded toward the big, metal door on his left. 
 
 “ How do you know you got the right guy? ” Chief asked. 
 
 “ He was standing outside of the arboretum telling people they were barking up the wrong tree. ” Howard paused. “ You know, bark: like a tree has. ” 
 
 “ My god, ” said Chief, lowering the folder down to the side of his left leg. 
 
 “ That—that wasn ’ t all, ” Howard said, stuttering slightly. “ When I approached him, he told me to leaf him alone. Not leave, but leaf. To leaf him alone. ” 
 
 Chief slowly walked to the wooden table in the corner of the room and lowered the manila folder onto the top of it. He placed both palms down and sighed. 
 
 “ We got a real sicko on our hands, Howard. You did good getting him off the street. Has he confessed yet? ” 
 
 “ No, sir. We sent Chuck in earlier. He came out in tears, an absolute wreck. He did n't even get a chance to turn on the recorder. Said he wouldn ’ t stop punning, that Al told him to spruce up the place. Said that it would help us branch out creatively. Chuck tried to play it off, tried to be the tough guy, but Al just didn ’ t let up. ” Howard turned his head toward the metal door to his left. “ Chuck told me Al claimed he had an idea for an escape that he maple off. Maple, not may pull. He made it clear that it was a pun. ” Howard exhaled deeply and stared up at the ceiling. “ He said Al called all of us saps, and that he wooden be surprised if he just walked out the front door. Wooden. Like wouldn ’ t. ” 
 
 “ Dear lord in heaven, ” Chief said, lifting his palms off the table then smashing his fist down on top of the manila folder. “ God damn this monster. I ’ m going to go in, ” he said. 
 
 “ Chief, ” Howard pleaded, his voice higher than he had intended it. 
 
 “ No, I have to do this. I can ’ t send any more of my men in. I need to be the one to face this maniac. ” 
 
 Howard nodded and took a step back so that the door was clear. Chief slowly unbuttoned his sport coat, revealing a leather holster underneath. He unlatched it, the grip of his Glock now exposed, then re-fastened the top button on the jacket. 
 
 “ Turn the recorder on by the window. If it gets too much, please leave the room. I will not hold it against you. Just make sure the recorder is running—we can ’ t let him go this time. ” 
 
 Chief exhaled, brushing the side of his hand down the front of his jacket, then made his way toward the door, unlocking it and pulling it open before stepping inside. Howard walked around the wall to the one-way window, flipped on the old tape-deck recorder, and peered inside. 
 
 “ Al? ” Chief said, sliding a chair out from the metal table in the middle of the room. “ I ’ m Dave Johnson, Chief of Police. Do you know why you ’ re in here? ” 
 
 Al glanced up at the chief, but seemed to be looking toward the corner of the room. 
 
 “ That, ” Al said, pointing to a whiteboard in the back of the room, “ over there. ” 
 
 The chief turned around. “ The whiteboard? What about it? ” 
 
 “ It ’ s remarkable. ” 
 
 Howard involuntarily smashed his fist down on the table in front of the glass, but the chief seemed not to notice Al ’ s pun. 
 
 “ Nothing remarkable about it. ” 
 
 “ The whiteboard, ” Al repeated, “ it ’ s remarkable. Re-markable. ” 
 
 The chief squinted slightly, as if he were in pain. “ Seems unremarkable to me. Now please answer the question. Do you know why you ’ re here? ” 
 
 Al sighed. “ Let me guess, is it because of the two pieces of string I ate? ” 
 
 “ What? ” said the chief. 
 
 “ The string, I ate two pieces of string. I shit you not. ” 
 
 Chief ’ s face became visibly tense, a reddish hue slowly replacing his normal pale color. “ You are here for your puns, Al. You ’ ve been on the pun, ” Chief stopped, his eyes wide. “ Run. You ’ ve been on the run for a long time, but we got you. And we have you recorded making these puns. ” 
 
 Al stared down at the metal table and his eyes closed. “ I know, ” he said. 
 
 “ So you admit it? ” 
 
 “ You think I like making puns? You think I like breaking the law? ” 
 
 “ If you don ’ t like it, then why do you do it? ” 
 
 Al slowly lifted his head back up toward the chief. 
 
 “ A long time ago, I was kidnapped and brutally tortured. My life was threatened and I was brought to the brink of death. Do you know what that ’ s like? Six men accosted me, beat me and chained me to a tree as I walked home. They said they ’ d tell me ten puns to dictate my future. If I survived, then I was free to go. They told me no one had ever lived through them, they assured me I would die. They laughed when they said that, stared straight in my eyes and pulled the chain tighter to keep me from squirming. Then they began. Each pun was said with hate, each one was meant to kill me. Yet in the end, no pun in ten did. ” 
 
 The chief ’ s eyes rolled back in his head, his torso slumping forward onto the table in front of him. He began convulsing, seizing hard enough to knock the chair out from under him, his body plummeting to the floor behind the desk. Howard tried to reach for the alarm on the far right of the window, to hit the button and call for help, yet his limbs refused move. His mind refused to listen. The room turned black. 
 
 Howard awoke to a uniformed man standing over him, one of the new recruits he ’ d not yet learned the name of. He was towering over Howard, yelling for him to get up. 
 
 “ Gone! ” shouted the recruit. 
 
 “ Huh, ” Howard said, voice groggy and slow. 
 
 “ He ’ s gone. He took the tapes and he ’ s gone. ” 
 
 “ Ch-chief, ” Howard said, pulling himself up. His arms felt weak, as if he ’ d spent the past few hours lifting weights. “ Where ’ s the chief. ” 
 
 “ He ’ s okay, we ’ ve got him in the office. He ’ s awake. You ’ re both going to be fine. ” 
 
 “ Al, ” Howard said, remembering the barrage of puns. “ Where did he go? ” 
 
 “ He ’ s gone, ” said the recruit. 
 
 “ Where did he go? ” Howard repeated, now shouting. 
 
 “ Gone, sir. He walked right out the front door. ” The recruit paused, but Howard could tell he wasn ’ t yet done speaking. “ We also have reason to believe the name we ’ ve been calling him is fake. ” 
 
 “ What? Why? We had him here, he responded to Al. All the background checks matched his name. ” 
 
 “ It ’ s just, his name. Mr. O ’ Bye. Al O ’ Bye. ” 
 
 A stinging pain shot through Howard ’ s skull. Alibi. Why hadn ’ t he seen it before; that was why his history was so clean, why he had been so elusive. They were tracking a ghost. 
 
 “ Fuck me, ” Howard muttered, holding his left hand to his throbbing temple. He stared into the empty interrogation room. 
 
 “ Sir, that ’ s not all, ” said the recruit. He picked up a folded piece of paper from table and handed it to Howard. “ He—well—he left you a note. ” 
 
 Howard stared at the paper. “ Detective, ” it read in cursive on the front, hand written in blue ink. He flipped it open. 
 
 “ You ask me why I do what I do, what makes me who I am. Yet you don ’ t even know who it is that I am. Perhaps I ’ m simply an unappreciated baker getting revenge on the world after suffering through long hours because I kneaded the dough. Maybe I ’ m a forlorn banker, doing this because I ’ ve finally lost interest. Or maybe I ’ m just a backwards poet, writing inverse and making no sense. Yet, in the end, you're not much different than I. You stay up all night and day, searching for me, wondering who I am, waiting for the light that never comes. Only when I stayed out too late waiting for that sun to rise, it dawned on me. 
 
 It ’ s been my pleasure meeting you, perhaps I will see you around. 
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Mae B. Layter ” 
 
 Howard lowered the note, a warm sensation running down his face as if an insect were crawling on the flesh above his lip. He placed his left hand beneath his nose, rubbed it, and then glanced down at his fingers. They were covered in blood. Darkness again drowned out his vision.

","The first thing you have to do is get your bearings. 
 
 I want you to understand that I do n't control the dream. Everything that I see has already happened the day before -- what I experience is just a recording. When I fall asleep, my eyes are not my own; my steps not mine to tread. And since I ca n't control my senses, the experience is disquieting, to say the least. 
 
 But feeling eyes not my own open, and seeing my own, peacefully sleeping face? That was a whole new level of... well, creepy. I was *Tom*, I realized. My husband. 
 
 At first, he just stared at me. It was kind of cute, really. He traced a curve on my face, and my body snored a little in response. Charming. 
 
 I felt his legs swing over the side of the bed as he sat up and padded down to the kitchen. If I could have smiled, I would have. He'd made me omelettes that morning, with little smiley faces in the middle. 
 
 Except he did n't get out the eggs, or the frying pan. Tom delicately picked up one of our butcher knives, flicked the blade lightly with a finger, and started coming back up the stairs. 
 
 The worst part, of course, was that I could n't even fucking panic properly. There was no adrenaline in Tom's body; his heart rate was as smooth and regular as it ever was, and I did n't have one of my own to feel beating faster. 
 
 He came into the room. He stood over me with the knife. He shivered. 
 
 And then he turned away, went back down the stairs, and started making omelettes. He used the knife to cut smiling faces into them. 
 
 And the rest of the day was as normal and sweet as I remember it being. I woke up 16 hours later in dream time, 8 hours in reality, and looked at the face of the man I loved. This time I'd woken up first. 
 
 And I had a lot of thinking to do.

","When Gutenberg invented his printing press, and thereby began the slow processing of opening the floodgates that had held back knowledge from spreading throughout the population, a call had to be made as to what would be printed first. The answer was simple, especially since the Church's power was so significant at the time. The first book ever created with the Printing Press was the Christian Bible. That speaks to the madness of humanity upon many levels. When we finally made the ability to create copies of our words, and through them our ideas, relatively affordable the first thing we did was recreate a religious text. 
 
 The second thing that came off the Printing Press was the Divine Institutes, and is relatively unimportant in the great scheme of things. The third book was, inevitably, pornographic in its nature. A similar chain of events can be seen in the creation of every form of technology meant for speeding the sharing of ideas... and the period of time it takes for people to realize exactly what potential applications their new medium has grows shorter. 
 
 Everything, from books to tape-recorders to motion pictures to the internet, that has ever aided humanity in communicating out thoughts has been turned towards the glorious cause of getting one's rocks off. Yes, at first the cause is generally the dissemination of ideas popular at the time and suited for the particular form of technology. But with time comes the realization of a new technology's potential for aiding humanity in its everlasting crusade for temporary release from the mating drive. 
 
 We the past in mind, we really should have seen Virtual Reality going in the same direction. The Bandwidth Boom of the early twenty-first century, instigated by a combination of regulatory reform and new competitors breaking the field's former stasis in the United States, combined with the suddenly maturing technology of Virtual Reality and unprecedented leaps in processing power. It was a perfect storm, and several new platforms rose in response to the suddenly available resources. Early platforms, such as Garry's World ( an `` spiritual sequel'' to Garry's Mod ) allowed for the formation of new `` Virtual Sites'' that could be designed to showcase virtually any suite of features that could be run on the Garry's World Engine ( which was itself a heavily modified version of the latest Source Engine ). 
 
 These Virtual Sites came in numerous variations originally. One popular, early, Virtual Site was simply a Movie Theater that supported custom avatars, allowing people to sit down together to watch a movie together without regard for distance between them. Additionally, several of the more progressive Christian Denominations managed to produce what amounts to a `` Video Call'' system that allowed members of their congregations whom were traveling to attend services. 
 
 Others were `` Recreations'' of popular video games of the past generations, which were created primarily by those who were already adept with the original Source Engine. These `` Game Sites'' were usually well received, although many of the earliest were shut down due to legal concerns. At least until the Remakes began to require a copy of the original game to operate, at which point most were allowed to function in the interests of continued sales. 
 
 As you can imagine, the Game Sites were usually rather violent as a result of their source material. The Black Mesa Project, Project Tamriel, and similar efforts recreated beloved experiences in glorious Virtual Reality... but they still carried the general stylings of the original game. This fed into the controversy that will be spoken of later. 
 
 However, Virtual Sites which provided more... carnal content appeared fairly soon afterwards. Early models were designed alongside the limitations of the hardware. Early VR Setups, such as the Occulus Rift Headset, could only stimulate two of the senses: Sight and Sound. As a result, interactive experiences were n't all that common. The lack of tactile sense was known to induce a bit of dissonance, which could lead to someone experiencing `` Rift Sickness'' if they had n't developed a tolerance for Dissonance. 
 
 > Side Note: Rift Sickness is the result of Dissonance between the body and mind's expectations, and what Virtual Reality provides. This is often caused by a lack of acceleration and other tactile sensations in VR. However anything `` trippy'' can induce Dissonance. Long term practice with Virtual Reality can lessen the effects of Dissonance, and those whom use it frequently often develop all-but-immunity to it. 
 
 As a result of the threat of Dissonance and Rift Sickness, most experiences were rather hands-off. Early examples were normally more voyeuristic than participatory, although exceptions did exist. Hands-On Experiences tended to be fairly niche, as only VR Enthusiasts were likely to be able to handle the Dissonance. As a result, they were normally tailored to the perceived interests of that demographic. The Hands-Off Experiences on the other hand tended to be a fair bit more `` ordinary,'' although you could find just about anything you'd ever be interested in as a result of the Rule 34 Principle in action. You just had to dig for anything `` interesting.'' 
 
 Response to these early `` Sin Sites'' was actually quite predictable. The response from the usual Moral Guardians was along the same lines as the opposition to Comic Books, every Genre of Music when it was new, Film, Pen and Paper RPGs, and Computer Games. Many claimed that the `` unprecedented realism'' and `` active choice'' involved in all actions made in VR merited harsher regulations, and its being classified outside of existing Free Speech principles. 
 
 Opposition to sexual, violent, and similar content was wide-spread, and calls for regulations were heard in every nation that had a significant internet infrastructure. The Untied States saw calls for VR Sites to be classified as `` public locations,'' which would allow what are commonly referred to a decency laws to apply. Similar efforts were made in most of Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. 
 
 However, cooler heads prevailed as they normally do. Historical precedent for these reactions were noted, and as such most governments did what they do best: they kicked the issue down the line until it stopped being an issue. Japan and South Korea, ever industrious even within the realm of politics, basically copied-and-pasted their existing relevant laws over. This is why there's a pixelation effect over the genitals in Japan-Hosted Pornographic VR Sites. However, those laws are slowly being relaxed. 
 
 Now, as Tactile Response Technology begins to emerge and Olfactory Simulation Tech begins to become affordable, even more realistic experiences are soon to become possible. Four of the major sensory groups will be within the realm of possibility for VR Developers soon. This is likely to create another `` boom'' in VR. In turn, that is likely to result in another wave of outrage as truly immersive experiences become possible to create. Virtual Reality and Reality are slowly becoming truly indistinguishable, and the first generation to have used lightly it for all of their lives is about to enter the adult population. 
 
 How will this effect us? Probably less than we think, but more than I'm willing to guess at. Virtual Reality has changed the world. It has provided a weakening to the Scarcity Effect in economics, by allowing a fair portion of the population to literally drop out of reality and have their desires fulfilled ( at least as far as two senses are concerned ) with minimal resource-cost. It has also improved communication by allowing people to meet within virtual space. Who knows what truly immersive VR might do? 
 
 We might some day see the idea of a Matrix brought to life, although we are n't likely to be human batteries. Retirement Communities might see a combination of a life-support systems and VR pods used to allow their residents to live as they would have while they were younger, while still allowing their families to visit easily. Perhaps more easily than they would today, if they allow for family members to connect remotely to their relative's VR Site. 
 
 All in all, it's the same old story. Progress shines bright, and by doing so creates ever darker shadows. Some people will want to dim that light so that the shadows stop being as scary. Others will desire to just crank it up, and see how long those shadows can hang on. As for me... I'm content to watch as thins develop, and drop my opinion in from time to time.

176398,"[ wp ] In a war , the American army is being slaughtered by Guerrilla warfare . But luckily , they have a secret weapon - Gorilla warfare .
","`` Sir! They're coming from everywhere! It's an ambush!'' 
 
 Sergeant Brock smiled as he heard the foolish Americans panic. They did n't stand a chance in the face of this surprise attack. He and his troops had been taking down one patrol after another in this same spot, disabling communications first and the troops themselves second. Even the occasional tank that came along stood no chance; how do you shoot an enemy that is right under your feet? ( Or treads, as the phrase went ). 
 
 The Americans had n't grown any wiser to their tactics, simply sending in more and larger patrols, hoping to eliminate the threat. But Brock and his soldiers deal with them effortlessly. 
 
 As he watched the chaos, he listened in to their radio signals, adjusting his headphones slightly. Rather than just cutting off their communication entirely, he simply used a neat new device to redirect the signal to himself, so now he gained Intel every time he took down another panicked patrol. They had avoided several variations in the paths this way, anticipating where the next patrol would be coming. 
 
 `` We need our backup, Sir! Where are they?'' The soldier sounded positively desperate as he addressed his superior. Brock could see the solider talking, backed up into the corner of the forest clearing along with a few others, surrounded by at least double their number of Brock's troops. 
 
 Another voice came in, a bit huskier and older sounding than the solider. `` Do n't stop shooting, soldier! The backup has been here all along! It's only a matter of moments before our Gorilla soldiers start turning the tide!'' 
 
 Sergeant Brock frowned, and tapped the headphones. Did that man say *gorilla*? Surely he meant `` guerrilla'', much like the strategy Brock was using. Shaking his head, he dismissed it. His troops were well trained, and made sure to scout the area first, every time. They actually had found a few troops hiding in the underbrush, but they were quickly dispatched. The enemy leader was disillusioned. There would be no backup for them. 
 
 At that moment, Brock felt a rush of hot air on the back of his neck, and he felt chills rush down his spine. Swiveling around, he found himself staring into the flaring nostrils of a flat, black face, covered with fur. Perched comically on top of the gorillas head was a hat, signalling his high rank. 
 
 Brock stumbled backwards, away from the gorilla, and it reared up on its hind legs, took a deep breath, and let out a resounding roar that shook the forest, pounding on its chest the whole time. 
 
 With shaking fingers, Sergeant Brock fumbled with his gun, flicking off the safety and aiming up at the gorilla. But before he could shoot, countless more apes dropped from the trees, wearing vests and hats. A couple carried guns, and one even had a bondolier of grenades across its chest, but the majority were empty handed. 
 
 While he was distracted, the lead gorilla snatched Brock's gun from his fingers, snapping it in half like a twig. Brock found himself getting lifted up into the air by the back of his shirt, the gorilla holding him up with a single hand. Brock was carried out of the underbrush, and his disbelieving gaze was greeted with the sight of his soldiers, crushed in combat with the gorillas, subdued quickly and efficiently. Every shot toward the gorillas was dodged, and hand to hand combat was out of the question. After only a few seconds, the first soldier dropped his gun and raised his hands into the air in surrender. The rest quickly followed suit. 
 
 The gorilla holding Brock lumbered forward, into the middle of the clearing, and stopped before the American patrol leader. Facing each other, the human smiled, and raised his hand into a sharp salute. `` Well done, Sergeant Silverback. Well done indeed.'' 
 
 Brock was casually passed from one massive hand to the other as Silverback stood up to raise his own right hand in a salute. Then, turning to the other gorillas, who had lined up in an orderly fashion behind him, he pounded his chest and let out a bellow of victory, and the noise quickly rose to a cacophony as the rest of the apes, and even some humans, joined in. 
 
 -- - 
 
 This was pretty fun to write!: ) I had a great time imagining these Gorillas, decked out in army uniforms. Disclaimer though, I literally have no clue how the army and ranks work, which is why you only hear Sergeant and Soldier. Pretty sure there's a corporal too, but I'm not sure how that all goes together.

176692,"[ WP ] You are the sole survivor of a 5 person expedition into the wild . Write about your experience , without letting the reader know about the fate of the other 4 people .
","Hunting, the five of us thought, would be easy this far from the settlements back home. The woods near our village in the frozen lands were all but hunted out, but everyone knew the wild lands were full of game. And they were, for the first month. The woods were full of deer, the plains full of bison, the rivers and lakes had abundant fish, once you broke through the ice, we ate better out in the wilds than we did at home. Our white sleds were stacked high with meat. But the farther we went, the fewer the forests that the deer lived in, the sparser the plains the bison roamed, the lakes turned into ponds, the rivers into frozen creeks that might only thaw through on the warmest days of the year. 
 
 We were so busy with our maps that we did n't notice at first, living out your dream, the pinnacle of your career as a cartographer, can do that. And then once we'd eaten through the food we'd hunted and started on the rations we'd brought with us, well we had more than enough for a month, and we were sure we would find more game soon. We were so confident of this, so sure of our safety, that no one even bothered to keep an inventory of what we had. 
 
 It was when no one caught anything for a week that we decided we should count out what we had left. Imagine our surprise when we had a weeks worth of food left with how fast we were eating it. We could stretch it to two, if we rationed, but even then the sled dogs had to eat, we could n't save much for ourselves. We stayed were we were for three whole days in blind optimism, looking for something to hunt, some fox or rabbit to snare, some body of water to fish, but we had gone to far, there was nothing. 
 
 Three and a half months into the journey we turned around to head home. Everyone welcomed the decision, but we all knew we had left it too late, that we should never have gone as far as we did. We had hoped that we would quickly return to the plentiful lands we had passed through, but while we found the occasional rabbit, or fox, they looked as lean and hungry as we felt, and provided little. Two weeks and two days into the return trip we ate the last of our rations and went hungry, saving the rest for the dogs. That lasted all of two days before we gave in. The dog's rations lasted another three days, split between all of us, before all 12 dogs and 5 humans had nothing left. 
 
 It was tough, killing the first dog, after spending months with the animals they were practically family, you knew each of them by name, by appearance, by their personality. We had often talked, during the happier days at the beginning of the expedition, of which were the strongest, the friendliest, the most loyal, each of us had our favourites. We made sure to kill them last, but by the time we did they were just so much meat to us. 
 
 The problem, of course, is that a month and a half trip by sled becomes much longer once you have eaten the dogs. It would take us at least a month to reach the areas where we were sure there would be game, another two months to get home from there. It was a long trip, to walk in the cold. We loaded the meat into one sled and took turns in the harness. Alice was the first to fall ill, something in one of the dogs, most likely. She stumbled on for a few days, but between the hunger and the illness, eventually we let her ride in the sled. 
 
 The hunger was a constant thing inside of us. You probably think you know hunger, that feeling you get when you miss a meal, or maybe when you go a day without food? That is not true hunger. True hunger is felt when you have n't eaten anything substantial in a week, two weeks, when it feels like your body is starting to devour itself because it needs something, anything, anything will do! 
 
 Joseph was the next to stop walking. He'd also fallen ill, probably from eating the contaminated meat in the sled, but what else was there? He kept walking for as long as he could, almost a week, driven by a desperate energy, he was determined to keep goin but in the end he had to give in and lay back in the sled. While the load was heavier, it's really our friends that keep us going, and we somehow manage to find the strength to carry on. 
 
 After a month of man-hauling the sleds ( where was the game we had hunted on the way here? These were the same lands as before, but barren now! ) Robert fell. A strong man, Robert, he pulled harder than any of us, a wall of muscle, a mountain of flesh he had been, but months of hunger and despair had sapped his strength, and a fall that once would barely have winded him left him incapable of carrying on. He rested on the sled, for the rest of the trip, leaving Sarah and I to pull. 
 
 To this day I do n't know what came over Sarah, for days I could see in her eyes the horror, the despair of the situation. She seemed lost inside herself, a shell of the person she used to be, restless and paranoid.She looked at me like I was a monster, a monster! It had been a hard trip, and all I had done I did to survive, and she was beside me the entire time, she had no right to call me those things! I still regret that it came to blows, luckily we were too weak to do much damage, and it was over quickly. Still, we both agreed it would be for the best if she rested on the sled for a while, while I did the pulling. 
 
 It's hard to pull the sled alone, that unending toil, its only really your friends that give you the energy to keep going. It was my friends that gave me the strength to continue the long journey home, and it was my friends that drove me all the way back to our village, where I and my sled, now painted red, were greeted with horror as I emerged from the woods.

","As still as a statue Baird stood staring at the t.v aghast as the morning news played. 
 
 `` Hello and welcome to breakfast with Becky Watson and John Arlington,'' the chirpy young anchorwomen announced before continuing. 
 
 `` It's Tuesday the 28th of February and these are your headlines.'' 
 
 It was this one line that had paralyzed the young man. The 28th of February, Tuesday... the 28th of February. As if the phrase were an ancient spell or curse it had left him frozen in place; mute like a child and every bit as uncomprehending as one. Still desperately trying to understand the situation he now found himself in, he collapsed into a chair in front of the t.v as for the 1st time in a long time he heard news that was actually news to him. 
 
 Perhaps it had all been a dream, perhaps he had imagined the whole thing, perhaps everything would be okay. This vain thought drove him to leap from his chair and rush to his garage. Unfortunately for him it was exactly that, a vain thought. Once again he was sent back into shock as he stood in the doorway to his garage staring at the workbench upon which he had laid and carefully covered his old friends body. 
 
 Stumbling towards the bench and placing his hands against the bottom of the sheet Baird began to shake with rage, his stomach turning as his anger bubbled up and seethed to the surface. Balling his hand into a fist he struck the steel table sending the whole surface into a violent convulsion as he cried out in pain. With that he collapsed to his knees and began to weep. 
 
 `` How have I sinned, what wrong have I committed, what mistake has so offended you that I would be the butt of this cruel joke!?'' Through tears of anguish and anger Baird howled at his injustice laying the blame, and the corpse he now knelt by, squarely at the feet of god. 
 
 `` What does it do for you, all that power, to ruin my life? How petty a thug you must be!'' 
 
 It had been at least a year, it could've been years, since Baird had known any day but yesterday. Long ago he'd lost count of how many times he had endured that day. How many times he had prayed that when he awoke it would be tomorrow. How many times he had cried as he had heard the headlines of the 27th of February again. Finally he had done something with the day, finally he had chosen to fight back, finally he had given up on seeing tomorrow and seized the day! As if some sick joke it was then he finally got his tomorrow, just as he had ruined it and maybe every day afterwards for himself. 
 
 When he was fired yesterday he did n't think it could've gotten any worse. At least he had his wife to come home to and comfort him he told himself the 1st time he lived through that fateful day. It must have all been a dream he told himself the 2nd time. It ca n't go on forever he told himself the 3rd time. He did n't tell himself anything the fourth time as he once again walked through his front door, quietly up the stairs to him and his wife's room and into their bed to see her and his `` friend'' Dan already there. 
 
 It had always been a competition between him and Dan; when he had lost his job and Dan been promoted though it became something else. Something cheating with his wife on him was now a part of. Alone and cast out into the cold there was no life to carry on with for him, nothing to do, no one to live for. This was why he thought he was destined to never see tomorrow at first. Perhaps there was n't a tomorrow for him? But there were only so many times Baird could endure the rejection, the loss, the loneliness before he could take no more. 
 
 It was after that point he skipped work that day. After that point he bought a handgun. After that point he made sure Dan would n't be setting foot in his house ever again. After that point he told his wife what he knew and kicked her out into the cold. Perhaps she would run to Dan, shame he would n't be around to take her in. It was the first time he had smiled in a day. 
 
 Now as if it were all some sick joke his revenge had been turned on him and he was stood over a corpse, motive, method and opportunity abounding about him. If yesterday it seemed as though there was no tomorrow for him, there certainly was n't one anymore.

 `` Do you uhh... Happen to know the way toooo...'' He made a motion at his waist and stared above my head, frowning. 
 
 I glanced over my shoulder to see yet another man loitering behind me. This one had a decent sized potato sack gripped tightly in both hands.

 `` Shut up!'' she yelled at me and yanked. I decided to go with it. I *was* feeling a little down, a little bored with life. 
 
 She led me to their van and bundled me inside. The able man kept his arms around me, quite needlessly I say, and the other groaned somewhere behind us -- the one called'Mags' demanded the injured man get behind the wheel and drive. 
 
 And so we were off. Turning this way and that. Breaking the speed limit. It was pretty exhilarating. 
 
 Soon enough we reached their destination. The van backfired and stopped, jerked forward, then stopped again. I was then led into some kind of dwelling. They yanked the sack off of me. 
 
 I corrected my hair as I looked around. The place was not bad. A large barn, by the looks of it. There were more people, at least ten. The man that had potato sacked me stood close with a pitchfork -- the business end aimed at my stomach. 
 
 I finally got a look at the woman, Mags. She had frizzy brown hair and was rather tall -- not at all a looker. She lifted her arms above her head all the while gazing into my eyes. I smiled politely. 
 
 `` Do you know why you're here, whore?'' she hissed. 
 
 I pursed my lips. What language! 
 
 `` Of course you do n't,'' she circled around me. The others seemed to view her with some kind of reverence. Yes, she was definitely the leader. `` You are here to serve us. To serve our God!'' She thrust her hands skyward once more. Rather dramatic. `` Bring her to the altar.'' 
 
 The pitchfork wielder jabbed it halfheartedly towards me. I obliged and walked to the back of the barn. Two people scurried in front and pulled a heavy hessian curtain to each side, revealing an elaborately set up altar, just as Mags had promised. 
 
 Mags skipped ahead and paused beneath the many flickering candles. She turned with a flourish. 
 
 `` Kneel,'' she pointed two fingers in my face menacingly. My trousers were rather new, so I drew the line at dirtying them. 
 
 `` Why should I?'' I asked. 
 
 Mags widened her eyes and stood closer. `` KNEEL!'' she shrieked. 
 
 `` You catch more bee's with honey.'' I said. Somebody giggle-coughed behind me. 
 
 Mags sucked in her cheeks. Her face took a lovely shade of red. She twirled and snatched a long bladed dagger from the altar shelf and swung it wildly through the air. A knife! I never expected this when I hopped out of that van. 
 
 She took the hilt in both of her hands and raised the blade like mad man... woman. 
 
 `` Take this blood offering -'' Mags uttered at a pleasant volume. 
 
 `` *Take this blood offering. *'' Those behind me repeated in unison. 
 
 `` Take this sacrifice as a gift of our Undying adoration, of our Eternal gratitude, of our Total loyalty -'' 
 
 `` *Take this sacrifice, a gift... the Adoration. Undying. Eternal uhh. *'' 
 
 Mags took a deep breath and blinked slowly, `` Our. Total. Loyalty.'' 
 
 `` *Our Total loyalty. *'' 
 
 `` In the name of the only true God-'' 
 
 `` *in the name of the only true God..*'' 
 
 `` MANOSH!'' she brought the knife down in a quick slice. Manosh? Manosh?? That was my name! Well, one of my names. I was known by a fair thousand. I could n't believe it! What were the odds? These people were here, worshipping and sacrificing for little old me. I had n't opened my mind to my followers thoughts since Jehovah had become the *oh so famous* number one. I'd been living amongst flesh for a few centuries now, here and there, odd jobs as I went. 
 
 I was flattered. 
 
 I raised my hand and Mags came to a jolting stop, inches from my chest. The mortal could n't harm me, but this sweater was as new as my trousers and to have it torn would be a true shame and entirely unfashionable. Mags stood frozen, confused. 
 
 I turned to the worshippers. They were standing huddled together only a metre away. Trying to get a good look at the show, I supposed. I felt a bubble of pride. 
 
 I rose my arms out from my sides and cooed, `` My children. I am so blessed.'' 
 
 They exchanged glances. Pitchfork man backed away. 
 
 Why were n't they exalting? This ought to have been the best moment of their lives. I was amongst them! Me! Manosh! 
 
 Ah. It occurred to me that they had not seen what they came for. Blood must be spilt. I knew well how man yearned for that crimson life source. 
 
 I flicked my wrist and Mags inverted. I wo n't bore you with the gritty details, but I will say that it was *spectacular*. The people were impressed, I think. They dropped to their knees and babbled. Some even bowed. 
 
 Oh yes. I was back!

","A chubby, sad man sat at a desk in an impossibly expansive cubicle office. The billions of cubicles formed organized rows that stretched to infinity and was lit by a ceiling of clinically scattered fluorescent lights. The office was empty and eerily silent. The office drone looked downtrodden and was five shades from a cadaver. He was staring at the floor as a man from the future knocked on the entrance. 
 
 `` Excuse me Francis. May I come in?'' 
 
 Apparently unperturbed by the barren landscape, the man just looked up at the newcomer and nodded. 
 
 `` Hi Francis. My name is Malak, and I come from the future. Right now you are dreaming, but this dream is very real. How are you doing right now?'' 
 
 The man sighed and let out an unenthusiastic, `` I'm doing good, thanks.'' He hesitated then asked, `` Am I... Is this.. heaven?'' 
 
 Malak smiled sadly. `` This is n't the afterlife yet and I'm just a human being. Although, I am sorry to say that it is your time.'' 
 
 Francis relaxed slightly, but still shifted in his chair uncomfortably. 
 
 `` I do have some good news. You see, I come from an organization in the future that tells people like you about the amazing impact they had. If I'm here, this means that your life had a huge effect on others and on the future.'' 
 
 Francis sat up and furrowed his eyebrows. He looked confused. `` But, what did I do?'' 
 
 Malak pulled out a tablet. He opened his mouth to read out the dead man's accomplishments, but stopped. Terror flashed in his eyes. On the LCD screen of the tablet was written: 
 
 > Francis Smith 
 
 > 1 Ex-wife, 1 Daughter 
 
 > - 2010 Bellevue Hot Dog Eating Contest - Second Place 
 
 > - Writes great TPS reports. 
 
 > - Cooks a mean burger. 
 
 The time traveler quickly recomposed himself and started, `` Well, actually your daughter unites the world and prevents World War 3. And you have brought a ton of happiness to your ex-wife. She still loves you and thinks about you often. Your daughter too. She also loves you a lot. As a matter of fact, she used what you taught her to stop a massive nuclear war.'' Malak beamed at his own wit. 
 
 Francis' eyebrows deepened further. `` But, my ex-wife hated me so much. And my little girl barely ever talks to me. Last time we talked, she told me that she was stripping at the Dirty Shack downtown. How could they-'' 
 
 `` Listen, Francis. I'm from the future and we do n't lie. They did love you very much even if they do n't know how to show it. Your daughter leaves her current job as a dancer in a few years to work at the UN. See? It all works out in the future.'' 
 
 Slowly, the cubicle worker began to stand up straight. Tears appeared in his eyes. He grabbed Malak by the shoulders. `` Really? Is that true?'' 
 
 Malak looked down at the harsh light of the LCD screen, then up at the crying, hopeful man on his deathbed. `` Yes.''

","Connor is distant. Even depressed. Too distant, too depressed. My husband insists that it's just a teen thing, just a phase, just a thing everyone goes through. But it's not. Bloodshot eyes, icy silences, dropping grades and calls from his goddamn coach. He hates my husband too, now, the man who helped me raise him, for all intents and purposes, his `` mom''. Which is strange. They used to be so close, the one Connor always came to for help. 
 
 I think it's drugs, to be honest. Seems like a stretch, but all the signs are there. I did do a bit when I was his age, but not so much that I started failing. Better search his room. He'd never fess up. 
 
 -- -- -- - 
 
 `` What the fuck are you doing with this?'' I'm holding a knife, found under his goddamn bed. I do n't care if I swore in front of him, he has a *knife* under his bed. He's just staring at me, eyes big and round, mouth hanging open. `` Well?!'' I'm shouting. It's scary, it really is. A knife. Not very big, but sharp. I'd rather I'd found fucking meth. 
 
 And he just starts crying. 
 
 It comes slowly, tears welling up in his eyes, starting to run down his cheeks. `` Con... ner?'' I ask, cautiously. Maybe my son's gone batshit. I put the knife down, walk over to him. `` You okay?'' He nods, slowly, hesitantly. I pull him into a hug. He really starts sobbing then. I press a kiss to his forehead, pull him as close as I can into my chest. This, I was not expecting. It's the most emotion he's shown in months. I lead him over to the bed, sit down on the edge. `` What's going on Connor?'' His mouth opens to speak, but nothing comes out, just a whimper. I sigh, I pull him into lap. He hides his face in the crook of my neck, tears soaking my shirt. 
 
 That's when I notice the cuts.

 I stare at him, at the scars. The world's gone silent. I'm in shock. I feel like I could cry. And I do, but I quickly swipe away the tears. I have to be strong for him. 
 
 He's off my lap now, staring at the wall, into the distance. He wants to run, to hide. I can tell. Crying, sniffling. `` I'm so sorry.'' He's absolutely, grade A, fucking terrified. 
 
 The words feel like a thousand pounds. I take his hand, like I did when he was a little boy, and rub small circles between his thumb and his pointer finger. 
 
 He looks like a little boy now, too. Small and scared and wide-eyed, like he was when he had a nightmare.

76501,"[ EU ] Rewrite Dexter 's Season 8 and it 's finale
","Deb is an emotional wreck for the early part of Season 8, after killing LaGuerta to save Dexter. Rather than quit the force and go on a private detective drug binge while waiting for the crook to reveal where he stashed the goods, Deb stays at Miami Metro and deals with borderline alcoholism on her off hours. Dexter slowly manages to salvage his relationship with Deb ( time lapse several weeks ), and she learns to live with the choice she made. [ We scrap the Doctor Vogel plot altogether. ] Enter the final antagonists: Angel Batista, hunting for LaGuerta's killer, and The Metro Murderer, slaying members of the Miami Metro PD and leaving their bodies in fountains and pools in the style of the Bay Harbor Butcher. Dexter is set on edge at the thought of a vicious copy cat killing his coworkers and other innocents and vows to kill the responsible party. 
 
 Weeks pass and Dexter & the police are no closer to finding the Metro Murderer than when they started. When the murders reached double digits the state police and FBI become involved. The special investigators' behavioral profile for the killer is that he is a member of the police force or works closely with them. He hates himself for his perceived disrespect / failures, but his cowardice prevents his suicide and so he carries out his desires for self-harm on his more successful and better respected colleagues ( `` A lousy, limp-dicked, wannabe cop is killing our brothers and sisters on the force. And I'll be damned if we're gon na let him get away with it!'' ). 
 
 We see a figure cloaked by shadows exit a municipal vehicle ( van/truck ) and open the trunk access. Out come a half dozen black garbage bags, conveniently placed in the water outside the police department with bright orange buoys painted with smiley faces. 
 
 The office opens to usual faces: Batista, Quinn, Dexter, Deb, assorted extras. `` Anybody seen Masuka? He was supposed to get me that report on the Soderquist scene yesterday. Said there was a backlog with there being 12 cases in as many weeks. Fuckin' cutbacks ruinin' this goddamn department.'' `` Have n't seen him.'' `` He ai n't in yet?'' `` His office lights are on.'' Camera cuts back to the smiling buoys. `` Well where the hell is he then? I swear if that asshole is watching porn in the surveillance van again, I will chop it off.'' Closer shot of one of the buoys, gently bobbing in the water. Offscreen voice [ officer on a police boat duty ] `` What the hell... Dispatch, I've got suspicious markers outside the station. Somebody should check these...'' 
 
 Cut to bags being removed and the area roped off with tape and news vans crowded around the parking lot entrance. 
 
 > Batista: We know who it is yet? 
 > 
 > slow camera turn 
 > 
 > Masuka: First tech on the scene said it was Deputy Chief Matthews. 
 > 
 > Batista stunned silence, then: Wow. Top brass are gon na flip. 
 > 
 > Masuka: And the press will jizz their pants 
 
 Season continues with building tension in the department, and hints dropped to the audience that several familiar members of the department could be the killer. 
 
 Then, about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through the season Dexter sees Jonah Mitchell ( son of the Trinity Killer ) exiting a hardware store. Dexter's mind races; his leniency on Jonah has cost a dozen police their lives, and he must know the identity of the Bay Harbor Butcher since he is orchestrating this rage filled pastiche of his work. Rather than clean, surgical precision in his process, Jonah savages the bodies of his victims. He tears them apart while they're alive. His knowledge and his actions make him too dangerous to leave to the police. He must be stopped, and he must stay silent. 
 
 Meanwhile, Debra has convinced Batista and company that the feds have got the profile wrong. That's why they've been unable to catch this bastard, because they're too busy looking at each other. This dirtbag is a brutal, bloodthirsty, animal and has a vendetta against Miami PD. He's a victim or a prior perpetrator, and he is taking his rage out on any cop he can find. Homicide turns their investigation on its head and starts running down suspects that would hold a grudge against cops. Get rid of the obvious names that ca n't have done it ( those on ankle monitors, in prison, out of state alibis, etc ) and they should have a workable list. A few days will pass and during a flippant conversation on how this is more time chasing their tails, Quinn tosses an open binder on his desk while he goes to `` get some decent fuckin' coffee''. Camera zooms on the list shown in the middle of the binder, and, amid a lengthy number of M names, is Jonah Mitchell. 
 
 Dexter prepares to take down Jonah, while Deb also decides to look him up after Jonah's credit card shows up at Miami ( hardware ) stores. Dexter prepares a kill room, gets his equipment ready, and heads to Jonah's apartment. The two get into a lengthy fight, Dexter being caught unprepared for Jonah's youth and athleticism. His needle knocked out of reach Dexter resorts to a rolling on the floor struggle, and is getting choked out as Deb walks in the front door, gun drawn. Cue discussion on taking Jonah in versus the need to take Jonah out. While Dexter is making his plea, Deb suddenly shoots Jonah in the head. Dexter is shocked by his sister's actions, and starts monologuing in his head about how Deb has changed, while Debra sets up the crime scene by placing a cleaver in Jonah's hand and cleaning up some of the mess before crime scene techs and backup arrives. She tells Dexter to go home, and that she'll see him later. 
 
 The department and the media readily swallow Deb's story, the Trinity Killer's son, likely killer of his family in Nebraska, had come back to Miami to slay cops who he blamed for driving his father into hiding. Deb receives a commendation and a promotion to Captain of Miami Metro Homicide. Dexter sits in the audience at the ceremony, thinking about what the future holds and how he can no longer rely on his skills to satisfy his Dark Passenger. His life and his family are too important, and seeing Deb take Jonah's life so quickly and calmly, he knows that he's damaging his sister, perhaps irreparably. Time to enter a quiet retirement from his killing days, and just live with his job, his family, and the memories of his kills. 
 
 Flash forward a year or two, Deb is pregnant behind the captain's desk, a conversation between her and Masuka revealing that the pregnancy is the result of a sperm donor since Deb ca n't find a relationship that works. Dexter, looking rather drained puts on a strained smile as he brings a trio of doughnut boxes around the office, stopping with Deb who takes an entire box herself. Conversation between them seems normal, almost as casual as season 1, but with a knowing silence filling their pauses. The scene moves to an early retirement party for Batista who has decided that he will try his hand at the restaurant business after all ( since his therapist has told him staying on the force to find LaGuerta's killer was holding him back from living his own life ). Dexter, Deb, Harrison, Masuka, Quinn, and background police are present. A great times seems to be had by all, with laughter and pleasant conversations filling the audience in on what has happened in the characters' lives and where things will go. 
 
 The final shot is of Dexter, seated between Deb and Harrison, at a large table with the familiar characters. The light sound of a pounding heart begins; softly it thumps amid the din of conversation and celebration, but the beats grow louder and more vivid as the camera closes in, until the pounding is all that can be heard, until we hear Deb say `` Dexter?''. And Dexter blinks. Fade out. Title Card. 
 
 
 *This prompt lead me to revisiting the series for the first time since the lackluster finale. I hope you like what I came up with, as I think it is ( as a loose overview ) superior to the plot of season 8. This way Dexter ends as I feel the character would most likely go out, not with a bang or a hurricane, but with a silent whimper as he collapses into the cover life he leads, knowing that killing again would likely be the end of him, but longing for nothing more than to sate his thirst for blood. And now I look to the clock and see I've been thinking and writing for about 4 hours. That's enough for now. *

 `` He is n't baptised, but I ca n't sense any sins on him,'' said Yaweh. God was confused. He could n't get a solid read on this kid. It made no sense though. He knew everything, nothing could be hidden from him. He turned to Lucifer, who was flipping a butterfly knife between his fingers, and wore a bored expression. He knew that it was Yaweh's call after all. If God deemed him clean, he could go, if not, hell would have one more soul. 
 `` What is your name my son?'' God asked. `` Do you remember your parents names at least?'' The boy smirked. 
 `` Should n't the Most High know something as simple as a kid's name?'' the boy replied. He pulled his hood over his head and continued to kick his legs. Satan laughed maniacally. 
 `` Hey I like this kid Dad, he's got moxie,'' said Lucifer, excited for the first time since the apocalypse ended. `` To think he could talk to *you* of all people like that... mind if I keep him?'' 
 `` Why would I wan na go with some spoiled little pretty boy who rebelled because he did n't like daddy's new project?'' the boy shot at Lucifer. He chuckled. He could see The devil's irritation. 
 `` Hey do you think you are?! Just because you're funny does n't you're exempt from eternal damna-'' 
 `` Quiet Lucifer!'' shouted God. His voice booming through what felt like the whole universe. `` Who are you and why did you come to this world?'' Yaweh finally realized the child was of a higher plane than himself. *But what could he be? *, Yaweh though. *I control life and death on this world* 
 `` No, you do n't,'' said they boy. He had heard Yaweh's thoughts. `` You may have permission to create it, but there is only one of me.'' the boy reached into his pocket and pulled out a skull shapped mask and an impossibly large sickle. Lucifer stood shaking in fear. Yaweh's tried not to show it, but he too was scared. `` I am the end of all. I was waiting for you guys. It's time for you to come home.'' The two began to run. They never thought this force would meet them and it was terrifying. Death shook his head. try as they might they could not escape, and they were the most important crops for his harvest. `` Sorry guys, I know you liked it here, but it'll fun fack home I swear!'' and without them even being able react, Death caught up to them, took his stance, and prepared for his final harvest of this cycle

","A cloud of dust trailed our convoy as we crossed the dessert. The occasional pop of gun fire echoed in the distance as some farmer paid off by whatever enemy we accrued feebly aimed in our direction. Whenever I cast my glance out the window, only a sea of never ending brown and yellow sand blowing earth scorched by the indomitable sun greeted my eyes. We made the typical gruesome banter common among soldiers, joking that we were so standard issue in our helmets bearing down on our brows, our guns strapped across our shoulders, and boots grating sand across our toes, that we would return home slightly-off mint condition in boxes. 
 
 When the explosion hit us, the monotony of sand dirt was interrupted by a brilliant radiance of red and yellow as fire sang towards the sky. With my ears ringing, I don ’ t remember much besides the hellish images of my brothers in arms releasing hellfire upon whatever local happened to stumble across our misfortune. A sharp pain engulfed the entirety of my lower body for a split second while the battle raged; however, in the split second, it disappeared in a dull numbness. When I inspected the damage, I couldn ’ t find my legs. When I tried to grasp my bloody stumps, pain ran through my arms as fragile and damaged bone tried to function in vain. Reality slurred into blurry lines as my brain couldn ’ t cope with the images before me. 
 
 Left in the carcass of a flaming military vehicle for too long, I never opened my eyes again. Instead I found myself in a space I couldn ’ t feel anything. Whenever I willed my eyes to open, I was greeted by the same sight as somebody when they tried to see using their elbow. Stuck with a monotonous ringing in my head, I couldn ’ t hear anything of my surroundings. When I opened my mouth to scream and shout and swear to a god who would permit this to happen to a man, nothing came from my throat. When I moved, my arms and legs went nowhere; only my torso could thrash around at my command. 
 
 Tied to machines, I became a prisoner to my own body. Deprived of sight, I could never see the daughter or wife I left behind in the states. Deprived of voice, I could never tell my story to another soul and truly understand the horror that would resonate through my voice. Deprived of limbs, I could never know a normal life without the aid of prosthetics I couldn ’ t afford. So I did what every prisoner does. I begged for freedom. 
 
 I thrashed my torso using the Morse code they taught us in basic to communicate to the outside world. I struggled against the hospital bed for hours, sending my message to anyone who would listen. Without a conception of time, the days stretched into weeks as I spent every waking moment delivering the same, simple message until either my body or consciousness passed out into sleep. When I awoke, I continued, stuck in a hellish cycle of activity and sleep without any other stimulus or diversion to distract me from my goal. Every day I sent the same message: “ Kill me. Kill me. ”

 I was tapping away on the computer at work when the phone lit up beside me. I hated the ringer. It reminded me of my alarm clock in the morning, yelling at me for the night before. I need to stop drinking on workdays, but it was so cheap to get drunk after giving blood. At least last night I managed to score at the bar. The pounding in my head sucked the enthusiam from my voice, as I monotoned `` Gerald Firth Technology, this is Leo, how can I help you?'' 
 
 `` Are you Leo Portune?'' the voice on the other end inquired. 
 
 `` Yeah.'' I sighed: hopefully not loud enough for them to hear. 
 
 `` I'm sorry I ca n't give you many details, but you need to see a specialist immediately. There's a police escort waiting outside. Go **now**.''

 The doors parted for me, revealing the bright glow of the morning sun shining off the marble floor of the lobby. My shoes clicked on the floor, taking me one step closer to the unknown outside the building. 
 
 Everything was exactly as the phone call said. Outside the building a cruiser sat silently: an officer leaning against the passenger door. 
 
 `` Get in,'' he said gruffly while opening the door. 
 
 The trip was silent. I could n't think of what to say, but I did n't really want to talk anyway. The tires yelped as we descended into a parking garage. A black Lincoln was parked in the middle of the otherwise empty garage. The officer cut the engine, and motioned for me to get out. A door on the Lincoln opened and a stiletto clacked on the pavement.

 Every day. 
 
 
 Every day with these bloody cookies. Every day with the warm, sweet scent of childhood wafting through the hundreds-year old house. Every day of a kitchen heated to uncomfortable degrees in order to coax the treats into deliciousness. Every day with these *bloody* cookies. And every day the only one to eat them is Dracula, and I have n't a damned idea why- 
 
 
 I can hear him retching in the downstairs bathroom, already. 
 
 
 `` You really should know better by now, County!'' Josephine calls out. `` You did n't even wait for them to cool down!'' 
 
 
 I meander down the hallway and into the kitchen, but no one's there. A half-empty plate of steaming cookies still sits on the baking rack atop the stove. Across the room, peering in from the dining hall, stands the resident werewolf. Unlike Dracula, he has the common sense to wait. He probably also has the common sense not to eat anything that makes him sick, but as of now that's simply speculation based on the fact that I have n't seen him down a bowl full of Silver-Bullet-Os for breakfast. `` Hey,'' I say in greeting. `` Waiting for cookies?'' 
 
 
 `` Nah, those are more the Count's thing.'' He shrugs. `` Just waiting.'' 
 
 
 Waiting? For what? 
 
 
 It's then that I notice the microwave vibrating. A moment later, the door flies off- I duck at it zooms by my head and slams into the hallway floor. The imp inside the microwave giggles maniacally, bursting into a ball of flames as it leaps out of the kitchen appliance and up onto the stove to devour the remaining cookies with one fell swoop of its dripping tongue. I can hear Mary yelling from the bathroom, then the heavy flow of air as she rushes into the kitchen. 
 
 
 `` DO N'T YOU TOUCH THOSE COO- *IMPY*!'' She angrily slams her fist down on the island counter, but it passes through to slam the backside of the silverware drawer. The drawer flies out, passing through her abdomen as the utensils are sent airborn. Several of them lodge themselves inside her. The rest clatter on the floor. 
 
 
 There's a fork in her eye. 
 
 
 She whines and turns her head down, attempting to hide herself as she pries the utensil from her socket. The various others are left forgotten, probably because she is n't actually aware that they're there. Then, in a fit of embarrassment, she cries the imp's name and flees the room. 
 
 
 `` Yeah, you know....'' I glance around the room. It's scorched in places. Merely burnt in others. The cold bowl of soup that someone had abandoned earlier no longer sits on the counter next to the microwave. Instead, its contents are splattered on the wall. And incinerated. Because why not? 
 
 
 The little imp sits on the stove, still flaming, because of course. 
 
 
 I turn and leave the room, heading up the stairs. Krampus is looming in the hallway, tall and foreboding. He must have forgotten his routing horn-shaving, because he's stuck *again* to the ceiling. There are tears in his eyes. I sigh heavily. `` Stuck?'' 
 
 
 `` I wanted a cookie,'' he replies solemnly. 
 
 
 `` I'LL BAKE MORE COOKIES!'' Mary yells. 
 
 
 Why. Why is this my life?

203674,"[ WP ] A group of children realize , in the worst way possible , the woods they play in brings their imagination to real life
","`` Your turn to seek Amy,'' Dylan said, `` We'll all hide!'' All of the neighborhood kids were in the woods behind the Benson's, playing hide and seek. The woods, with it's endless crevices and hideaways, was great for the game. 
 
 This game, Amy was up to seek. She was a quiet girl, never one to like being put on the spot. Still, it was only hide and seek. She spins round, counting to 60 as the shrieks and giggles of the other kids fade away. `` 59, 60!'' She finishes. Amy set out into the woods, looking for the other kids. She finds the first kids easy, their giggling giving them away. `` Found you Harris!'' Amy shouted. This was n't so bad. She could have fun with this! 
 
 The game went on, with Amy slowly finding the rest of the kids, those who were found joining in her search. All except one. Dylan. Amy was worried. It had been too long. Much too long. What if something happened to him? No, no. She ca n't get too worked up. She always got too worried. Still. it had been an hour. Amy sat up from the small circle of kids sitting in a clearing. `` I'm going to find Dylan,'' She announced, though no one heard her. They were all too absorbed in their own conversations to notice the quiet girl in the back. 
 
 With the sun setting, the once welcoming forest was now foreboding. It seemed ancient and vengeful. Scarier, in a way. `` Dylan?'' She asks the empty air, hoping for a response. Nothing. Where could he be? Despite the fact that it was a muggy summer evening, the air felt cold on Amy's skin. She stops, shriving when she hears the noise. A guttural, terrified scream. The voice... It belonged to Dylan, and he was close. `` Dylan!'' Amy shouted, all chill forgotten as she ran to the noise. 
 
 She arrives in another clearing, this one much smaller. In the middle lies Dylan, blood staining his shirt. Blood across the forest's floor. Blood. So much blood. Amy is overwhelmed. It was what she had feared. `` Dylan.'' She whispers, barely audible. She does n't step closer. She does n't leave. She just stays, too shocked to move and too afraid to do anything else. `` Dylan...'' 
 
 Little did she know, Dylan was safe at home, eating dinner with his parents. `` So how was the woods?'' His mother asks. In between mouthfuls, Dylan gets out a response, `` It was ok. I left early though. I got bored hiding.'' 
 
 `` Well at least everyone had fun, right?'' His mother says, `` and do n't chew and speak at the same time honey.'' Dylan nods, swallowing everything in a large gulp before replying, `` Yeah, we all love it there.''

","When Mike picked his son up that afternoon, he tired pull up close to where his son was waiting on the sidewalk, like always. But as soon as they made eye contact, Clay was up and jogging toward the car, face strained. Looking at his face now, at the first red light, Mike was still trying to figure out if Clay jogged to him out of excitement or embarrassment. The timid smile he gave when he opened the door didn ’ t give much of an answer. He wished he could just ask. His son was entering the terrifying uncertainty of becoming a young adult, with added difficulties that he had never experienced. He wished he could say something. 
 
 “ How- how was your day, son? ” 
 
 The timid smile fell. “ It was okay. But Dad, Mrs. Spears got angry with me because my locker is too messy, she left a note telling me to clean it during recess and everyone else played a big game of tag and I missed it. ” 
 
 If only his son could always give such quick and breathy complaints, speaking in never ending run-on sentences. 
 
 “ And then afterwards when I was upset, Joey said it didn ’ t even matter, because it ’ s not like I could play tag anyway, but he ’ s an idiot because you don ’ t have to yell that'you ’ re it' to play tag, because you tag them, so you don ’ t have to hear or talk to play, and I think it ’ s dumb that he thinks I can ’ t play because I totally can. ” The indignant scowl on Clay's face made it hard for his father not to smile. 
 
 “ You ’ re right that you can play tag, but listen to me. Son, I don ’ t ever want you to feel held back by who you are. Sometimes there are going to be people who make you feel like you can ’ t do something, but you need to do what you just did and recognize that they ’ re not the smartest, and you can do anything. 
 
 “ That said, keep your locker clean. Mrs. Spears might seem harsh, but you do have to listen to her since she ’ s your teacher. Keep your locker clean in the same way I make you keep your room clean. ” 
 
 “ Whatever, Dad. Okay. ” Clay folded his arms, looking out the window grumpily. He was still mad about Mrs. Spears. 
 
 Mike would find out about the dirty locker later that night, in an email from Mrs. Spears. He would never have this conversation with his son, and he would never have the opportunity to think that the word ‘ whatever ’ was the most beautiful word in the world when Clay said it.

265829,"[ WP ] You 've woken from a coma with no memory of your life . Friends , family and loved ones are all trying to get you back up to speed - but their stories do n't add up .
","I wake up. I'm an laying on my back. The floor is cool. I do n't remember going to sleep. The panic of complete disorientation begins to set in. I survey the room. I guess it is n't really a room, is it? The walls are too odd, too round. I hear the faint sound of running water. A trickle in the distance that I had subconsciously gotten used to, but stood out upon my awakening senses. The panic does not dissipate in a wave of understanding. It festers. I try desperately to recall where I was last night and, as the panic grows, I realize that I can not recall anything at all. I sit upright. Another sound. Footsteps. Panic growth sustained. A shadow starts to dance on the wall to my right, and the footsteps grow louder. The shadow looks somehow threatening. I try to imagine what a comforting shadow would look like. I imagine a hunched grandmotherly figure, but in the moment that would probably seem ominous. 
 
 heedless to foreboding, a man enters the room. He does not look as threatening in relatively full lighting. Glasses and a button down shirt give off an almost comforting vibe, and I know that I am in no immediate danger. He looks surprised to find me conscious. 
 
 `` Do you feel okay? You sure took a real whamdinger to the head there partner.'' 
 
 My panic had receded slightly, but his weird colloquialisms almost bring it on again. I am now more confused than scared. His tone of voice had sounded genuinely concerned, but no amount of genuineness could begin to reconcile waking up in a cave without my memories. 
 
 `` I am more confused than hurt. I ca n't seem to remember anything.'' I discover that my voice is rough with disuse, and I almost have to choke the words out. I wish that the distant water was n't so distant. There is a flash of something that I ca n't intemperate on the man's face. The skeptic in me wants to call it a realized opportunity. 
 
 `` Really? Shoot, surely you remember me. I've known you for years.'' 
 
 The dissonance between his appearance and dialect make him easy to not believe, and I start to consider insanity as a real possibility. Can an insane person tell that they are insane? 
 
 `` If we know each other, then surely you can explain what I'm doing waking up in a cave without any memories.'' I try to keep my voice neutral, in what I imagine is polite disbelief. My voice is n't really cooperating, though. 
 
 `` Well shoot, you was gon na tell me that. You dragged us out to this cave last night. I reckoned that it might have been treasure, but you would n't ever tell us for sure.'' 
 
 I ca n't decide if that's the sort of thing that somebody would come up with on the spot. I am only annoyed by the lack of solid answers. The number of questions that I could ask starts to overwhelm me, and I decide to just go along with the man for now. I start to stand all the way up, and almost fall over forwards. I recover myself, but feel like I have to vomit. The man approaches me, and pats me on the back. 
 
 `` If you really do n't remember me, my name's Randy. If you do remember me and are just pulling some sort of goof, then that's not very funny, Renoldo.'' 
 
 I visibly recoil. 
 
 `` My name's Renoldo?'' Randy looks more concerned. 
 
 `` No. You really do n't remember, do you? Your name is Alex.'' 
 
 At least that's a step up from Renoldo. Randy guides me to the opening that he entered from, and the sun temporarily blinds me. When I have regained my vision I see a group of spectators, all watching as Randy and I approach. There is some sort of camp set up on the hill outside the mouth of the cave. The people watch us eagerly, and I am only 40 % sure that I am not about to be killed and eaten. I do n't think that I can run from anyone in my current state however, and decide to be lead up the hill. 
 
 A woman steps apart from the crowd and approaches us. She looks first at me, then gives a questioning look to Randy. 
 
 `` So... Is he everything that we'd hoped?'' I am now only 20 % sure that I wo n't be eaten. 
 
 `` He's a little worse for wear. He says he ca n't remember anything. I was hoping there was something in the texts that mentioned this.'' 
 
 I begin to feel like a kid whose parents are discussing his future. I mentally stammer for something to interject with, but everything has been so nonsensical up to this point that I only come up blank. The woman looks at me, not unlike a piece of meat, and looks as if she's come to a decision. 
 
 `` Why do n't you go back and read them again. I'll take care of Alex, meanwhile.'' 
 
 Randy does n't look too happy about this, and I ca n't say that I feel too good about it either. Too many variables. I was just growing used to his southern cadence. The woman approaches me, and I almost start to back away, mentally ciphering through all the possible meanings of'take care of'. She stops before she gets to me, though. 
 
 `` Is it true, Alex? Do you really not remember anything?'' 
 
 `` Consider me an etch-a-sketch in a dryer.'' Fuck it. If life is going to be weird why should I not be? 
 
 The woman looks confused, and I take a weird pleasure from that. 
 
 `` This is no time for jokes. Do you have the cure or not?'' 
 
 I almost groan from the new layers, the new things that I might have to keep track of. 
 
 `` Listen, I have no idea what you're talking about. For all I know you're about to kill me and eat my corpse.'' 
 
 The woman looks offended by my sudden hostility, and then a little scared. I feel bad, in spite of myself. 
 
 `` I'm sorry Master, it's just that... none of the texts mentioned amnesia.'' 
 
 `` Master? Why are you calling me master?'' 
 
 `` You are the chosen one. We've all read your writings. They were illuminating. At the end of the text you prophesier that you would arrive in this cave, and that you would have the death cure.'' 
 
 I actually do groan this time. Why ca n't past me have been a librarian or something?

","Holy light flickered at the corner of his vision. He stayed perfectly still where he was, crouched on the ceiling. 
 
 `` Our arrows shall blot out the sun.'' 
 
 He breathed. It was a reflexive action. The liquid in his lungs directly injected oxygen into his bloodstream. The flexisteel body suit hid his movements as he crouched flat against the ceiling's elaborate tiles. 
 
 `` Our Blood shall drown the City.'' 
 
 He drew his weapon of choice carefully. A carefully constructed repeating rifle filled with phosphorous rounds. Each round was an explosive ranged projectile. He did n't want to take any chances. 
 
 The human-shaped, inhuman creature beneath him held up a golden goblet before the assembled, deformed creatures in the vast chamber below. They writhed in orgiastic violence as they bit and tore at the air. Blood bubbled in the goblet held aloft. 
 
 The leader of the vampires smiled a smile with absolutely no goodness whatsoever within. 
 
 `` Tonight, we shall destroy the Church!'' 
 
 The goblet began to tip. He relaxed, his time sense slowing as a number of rather poisonous chemicals were temporarily activated in his blood. 
 
 He pulled the trigger. 
 
 A flash of light illuminated the black chamber below, blasting through the vampire leader's head and exploding. Light and fire erupted across the platform, spreading rapidly into the lower chamber as he turned his weapon towards the pandemonium of fang and blood. 
 
 He dodged to the side, landing sideways on a nearby pillar abruptly as some danger sense pinged. 
 
 The headless body of the vampire leader crawled on the roof towards him, clawed hands digging rapidly into the roof as it headed straight for him. He barely dodged as it lunged again, crushing the pillar in one blow. He pulled the pin off a phosphorous-tinged grenade just as the vampire leader caught up to him. 
 
 Fire exploded in his vision. Heat and light seared through him as his suit broke under the force of the grenade. He was flung back against another pillar, his breath knocked out of him as he came to a stop. 
 
 The leader of the vampires lay in pieces where he had last been standing. He managed a smirk as blood bubbled up wetly from his throat. He choked and coughed where he lay amidst the rubble of the pillar he had landed against. 
 
 The other vampiric creatures were closing in. They could smell his blood, his life through his open suit. 
 
 He had one more grenade. He knew exactly what to do with it as they closed in around him.

 `` Is this all we have?'' He whispered over to Jesus, who shrugged. 
 
 `` You said you were going to create more and then we went on that Shuffleboard tour off Florida for three months, remember?'' Jesus hissed back. 
 
 God slapped his head, it had completely slipped his mind and then a couple of billion years had slipped past and now they were here. it was always hard to keep track of these things. Still, the last time he'd fought Lucifer it had been fine, half a dozen rogue Angels against God and his dreamy dozen, it'd be fine again. 
 
 Clearing his throat he summoned up a grand speech. `` Angels of Heaven, I come to you now at the turning of the tide, One stage of... uh... now is over, another begins. War has come to... uh heaven and we must we must ride to... Edoras with all speed.'' he finished and grinned. 
 
 Jesus held his head in his hands. `` Really Dad? That's from the fucking Lord of the Rings movies! We just watched them last night.'' 
 
 God turned and hissed back down at him. `` No one will notice, it's fine. it all applies.'' he turned back to the Angels. `` `` Fight and you may die. Run and you will live at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one cahnce, to come back here as young... uh... angels... and tell our enemies that they may take our lives but they will never take our freedom!'' he held his hand aloft and a few angels half heartedly cheered a little. Jesus sat down heavily and rubbed his temples. 
 
 `` See I came up with that one all by myself.'' God smugly said to Jesus as he left the plinth and got onto the chariot awaiting him. `` Open the gates of heaven and let's get this over with. I want to be back in time for a *Will and Grace* marathon before lunch.'' 
 
 The grand gates of heaven slowly inched open and God on his chariot pulled by white horses wheeled forward slowly, followed by Jesus and the dozen Angels. As the gates cracked, a strange humming noise came in and then darkness seeped in and began to pool in the entrance. God looked at it curiously but continued forward. 
 
 As the gates opened wider the hum grew louder and then they saw it. It was the noise of billions of souls, screaming in agony as they sat on the spectral planes in front of heaven, dragging forth huge siege weapons. Millions of demons, most tens or hundreds of feet tall stalked their lines, whipping, crushing or devouring those who did not work or pull hard enough. 
 
 Behind then, just visible in the distance stood wave after wave of eight feet tall warrior demons, each clad in fine dark armour and holding horrific looking huge guns. Above huge winged beast spouted flame into the air and let out blood curdling shrieks while flexing vast razor sharp claws. 
 
 God looked over the plain and then glanced back at his dozen men, only half of whom were carrying rather blunt looking swords. He stepped backwards off the chariot and muttered gently to himself. `` No, no no, I do n't think so.'' he turned and clapping Jesus on the shoulder he handed him his sword and stepped away. 
 
 `` Sort this out lad, I think I'll catch an early lunch.'' God wandered back into the condos of heaven, patting his pockets for his tobacco pouch. 
 
 Jesus looked out over the vast assembled army and sighed. He wondered if it was too late to try that whole second coming thing that his Dad had always vetoed.

","Oh, it is you who have misjudged your position. Sir, ” With that, Colin turned the cyber-chimps loose upon his former master. Dr. Hegemony ’ s wails of pain and fury echoed through the halls of the base, sending a message to his soon-to-be subordinates that the king was dead, long live the new king; Colin. They will learn to fear his name like no other. 
 
 He had dreamed of this day for nine long years; apprenticing under low-level thugs, steadily working his way through the underground hierarchy with verve and brutality until finally, his infamous deeds were recognized by the Syndicate. Rather than kill him, the Syndicate promoted him from the streets to mid-level management. They started him out small, pairing up as sidekick to some C-level players; Dastardly Dave, the Bulleteer, François the Shaver. After five years, Colin finally received orders to serve as number two to Dr. Hegemony himself. However, it didn ’ t take long for Colin to realize that the moon wasn ’ t going to be big enough for the both of them. Thus began his four-year plot of usurpation and corruption which would ultimately claim the life of the infamous Dr. Hegemony and serve as the coronation of a new super-villain, Colin the Conqueror; long may he reign. 
 
 Now, to be clear, the syndicate had a strict no-usurpers policy and would normally vote to unanimously block his ascension to super-villain status. However, Colin also had control of a moon-base, giving him an insurmountable advantage for future negotiations. The revenue he could generate on just space-based laser ransoms alone would fund the whole Mars expansion operation. Bottom line; he had the council by the balls. 
 
 However, to seal the deal, Colin would need a demonstration of his capabilities. Nothing too flashy, he didn ’ t want to come off as needy. It had to be impactful, yet subtle, something to demonstrate his ability to maximally undermine society while minimizing the chance of retaliation from the Foxy Foursome. He would deal with those meddlesome teenagers soon enough, but only when the time was right. 
 
 “ I have an idea, why don ’ t you switch out the entire planets coffee supply and replace it with decaf— “, a flick of Colin ’ s plasma lance cut off Captain Forceps last word—and his head—in one fell swoop. For such an insignificant dolt to presume to lecture him, Colin the Conqueror, whilst in mid-plotting was the height of disrespect and familiarity. However, Colin had to admit, the chucklehead ’ s idea was not without merit. 
 
 To hoodwink the entirety of humanity into thinking that decaffeinated swill was actually their precious, legal speed was just the kind of out-of-the-box subversion that the Syndicate appreciated. Hell, he could do a 24 hour proof of concept to coincide with his earth-bound negotiations. It would give him an ever-so-slight advantage at the table, subtly decrease global productivity and also serve as a pretty amusing prank on his future colleagues. It was perfect. With that, Colin the Conqueror, first of his name, set to work. 
 
 It only took Colin a week to set his plan in motion. It was a simple matter of hiring Bart the Black Hat to create an algorithm designed to reverse the packaging protocols at each automated giga-factory, then modifying transportation lead times so that the target coffee simultaneously arrived for consumption around the globe on November 19th. He couldn ’ t help but be pleased with himself as he traveled down to Earth to face off with the board. 
 
 Once his transport descended to suborbital space, Colin got his first inkling that something was amiss in the form of a freight glider coming mere inches from his cockpit before careening into a nearby satellite. “ What the hell is going on? ” Colin gasped, switching his HUD display to visible light to survey the area. What he saw made his jaw drop, he felt his bowels loosen as he tried to determine the diameter of the fire he was seeing. It looked like half of North America was ablaze. Upon closer inspection, the fires were smaller but so close together from above they looked to be one solid mass across the landscape. 
 
 Reluctantly, Colin the Conqueror set his transport to hover and turned on his communication feed. A disheveled blonde woman in a dusty pantsuit appeared on the screen, stunningly attractive despite the makeup smeared across her face; her eyes bore a hunted, haunted look as she spoke. 
 
 “ This is Talisa Brockwood reporting from downtown Indianapolis where rioting has continued unabated for the past six hours. Details are still being confirmed, and it would be wildly irresponsible to speculate, but it appears that the unrest began simultaneously at customer service and IT departments across the downtown area. Firsthand accounts are stating that these employees began exhibiting aggressive behavior towards their older colleagues shortly before laying siege to their respective HR departments. After the HR personnel were successfully boiled, employees then contacted their children via cell phone to join forces with their teachers in berating them. The only explanation for this sudden rash of violence would be the vernal equinox, we -- ” 
 
 Colin the Conqueror had seen enough to realize that his humorous little game had blown up in his face; this was exactly the kind of gaudy spectacle that the syndicate despised. Moon-base or not, this disaster, combined with the usurpation and murder of the current syndicate head, would cause the board to declare him unfit for service and immediately move for termination. Luckily, the fact that he was moon-side during most of this event gave him some measure of plausible deniability, or so he told himself. With that, he directed his communicator to contact the board. 
 
 Instead of the board, he was immediately greeted with Master Mephisto ’ s gnarled face, “ Colin. Let me ask you, do you think you are the first usurper the Syndicate has dealt with? ” The shock of the moment left Colin dumbstruck. How did they know? I had disabled the communications center before I disposed of DR. Hegemony. As was his nature, Mephisto continued to monologue “ When you have been engaged in criminality as long as this organization, you learn one undeniable truth; without coffee and booze, society can not function. The Chicago fire, WWI, the Waukesha rebellion and now this, each disaster set in motion by one of our organization, always a promising upstart with delusions of grandeur, operating on the assumption that he had the upper-hand on the council. ” Mephisto barely paused for breath, he was hitting his stride now, “ The usurper feels totally in control, until an incompetent subordinate has the temerity to suggest a “ coffee swap ” plot, it is like catnip to burgeoning megalomaniacs, you can set your watch to it. May I introduce Headless Harry? ” 
 
 Captain Forceps strode into view, “ Hello Colin! Sorry I wasn ’ t up front with you but the Syndicate always has contingencies ” Colin slumped into his chair, defeated. “ So let me guess, the coffee ploy was the signal that I finally made my move? ” 
 
 “ Precisely! You were always a smart one Colin. Well, I would love to continue to chat but we have forwarded your location to the Foxy Foursome, who should be at your location any second now. They do our bidding more than they could possibly imagine, they really are a helpful bunch. Choi! ” 
 
 Colin caught a glimpse of glitter out of the corner of his eye…they were here. He closed his eyes, resigned to his fate. In the distance, the chant began, 
 
 “ Love! ” 
 
 “ Friendship! ” 
 
 “ Rainbows! ”

","The trouble with a multiverse is that it is inevitably infinite. And that means that stories are, in some crook of the universe between the manifestation of your dreams and the universe where everything is made of tapoica pudding because pi is closer to 3, real. 
 
 I was reborn by the intervention of a Random Omnipotent Being to a lord's family, in 2E 445. We are the Styrmhand family. Supposedly, we were descended from the favoured demigod son of the Norse god Thor. 
 
 Sorry. Not Norse.'Northman'. 
 
 Bloody fantasy settings. 
 
 Growing up was peversely weird yet exciting. Bearing all the memories of a 21st century nerd, I was eager to introduce the printing press and germ theory and gunpowder once I realised that the dribbly candles everywhere were our primary light source. 
 
 The trouble is that... I did n't knkw how most of that stuff worked beyond'make metal stencil thing''boil your stuff you fucks' and'what do you mean you have no idea what saltpeter is'. 
 
 Learning to walk was strange. My body felt increasingly close to my own, but whatever ROB had dumped me in this universe had apparently fixed my feet from splaying out like a duck: or maybe my regular exercise routine of a light jog in the courtyard from 7 years old onwards had gotten me into good habits that I did not do in my original life. 
 
 My vision was shitty, though my father had sent off my designs for'spectacles' off to a friend of his. 
 
 Historically, the world was plagued by repeating cycles of war and peace. 
 
 Apparently, our ancestor, who was the common root of all noble families apart from those who gained their title as a merit for their deeds, had come down from our local version of Aesirheim or whatever, declared himself king of the tribespeople, and built a suspiciously Arthurian kingdom, all focused on the Hammer of Thor as the symbol of his office. A stone hammer. 
 
 The hammer was lost after the basically French people took over our seemingly close-to-Britain analogue, and so, while there was a King, decided by whoever squatted in the castle Thor's son decided to Arthur us around in, he was constantly challenged by others descended from the many dynasties who had equal claim. 
 
 The balance was kept mostly because it was not profitable to squabble over the rulership... 
 
 Unless the King dies or abdicates, and the inevitable war that ensues as our country and continent turns into a giant game of musical chairs. 
 
 
 You may be able to tell that I found this a strange system, but what fascinated me most was magic. Wizards did battle alongside soldiers. Our castle was supposedly kept warm by a dragon egg under the foundations, apparently descended from a red one from the barbarian tribes to the west ( when I discovered my native Wales existed in this universe, I was so happy, til I realised that I would likely die unless I pillaged and slaughtered the actual people there til they accepted me as their lord ). Spells and incantations supposedly worked. 
 
 I the only son of a prominent lord who had openly stated that he had no issue with the current royalty, so long as he could continue to have his lands be the lucrative breadbasket region of the land. We commanded many knights, but many were in reality just farmers who liked to get in armour each Training Day to impress their community. 
 
 As the only son, I was spoiled rotten. 
 Magical objects that glowed and sparkled with unknown power were bought for me freely. 
 
 I could n't cast a spell, but I understood a lot of the principles and logic behind magic. 
 
 And it was bloody awesome. 
 
 I had a magic ring with what looked like a kappa engraved on it that could make me double jump as though I was jumping off solid ground. Because fuck da rules apparently magic can make you a video game character. 
 
 
 
 Being a bookish sort, my father's attempts to get me to learn swordplay and archery and other ways of war. He eventually took me hunting, and I came back so proud of the one fox I killed... 
 
 Never mind that the bloody thing stank so bad. 
 
 Time passed, and I soon was a young man, and it was time for me to learn what it means to be a Lord. 
 
 I accompanied my father on the long trip to what I kept calling Camelot, but it was like Camërhicht or something daft like that. My uncle had often joked that this place was the most strict, imposing place that paradoxically had the best whorehouses in the world. 
 
 I would have tried one, had I not been under the watchful eye of my father. 
 
 The High Court was fancy as fuck. Marble floors. Copper grounding around the stone throne. 
 
 People milled about, playing the political game, but I ended up gossiping with my cousin, Borghilde, about our ongoing D & D-esque game we played by post. I had been bitching about how she had not replied to me in over a month. 
 
 `` I have n't had time to think of what Saliel would say to the High Priest, my mum was preparing me for this bollocks.'' she said, pointing down at her dress. It was well made I guess. Whatever. 
 
 `` I know what you mean. Apparently we're supposed to bugger about and be all backstabby and horrible with them lot,'' I pointed to the crowd, `` but honestly I want to just explore the city.'' 
 
 She grinned conspiratorially at hearing me say that. 
 
 I groaned, knowing her next words. 
 
 `` Wan na sneak out and explore the city then?'' she said. 
 
 `` My dad... He'll probably castrate me and make me a part of the clergy if I dive out on this. Apparently'you have to be there today son, so I can pledge my family's full allegiance to the King!' blah blah blah.'' 
 
 I mimed my father's moustache around my mouth, and Borghilde giggled. 
 
 Eventually, bugles flared, and all the nobles found a seat. My dad grabbed me by the earlobe and pulled me to a chair. 
 
 King Harald was that kind of stoic bugger who would be very quiet then say something more piercing than a dagger. While on business. Supposedly there was a scandal because he was a party maniac when not actively Kinging. 
 
 Every fourth year of his rule, there was a meeting of noble families. Nobles would pledge themselves to their ruler, and get to meet each other in person. Most of them. Some could n't come. 
 
 It was an old custom, in theory designed to prevent backstabbing bastards murdering each other by making them all friends. 
 
 In practice, it meant a lot of gossip and posturing. And veiled threats. And idiotic drunken verbal contracts and backhand dealings. 
 
 The king announced the change to the laws of the lands we enforced. Increased taxation but tax relief if we paid them ahead of time, the ongoing threat of the basically Welsh bastards, it is now illegal to bang a horse even on Loki's Day, the usual crap. 
 
 `` Oh, and another thing. There have been sightings of dvegar to the South. If you meet one of the Elves, or any of your people do, treat them as you would a fellow noble. With chaste respect and tolerance. I'm looking at you, Boderwyn, no shagging elves like you fucked that Hargyle bird in our campaign!'' 
 
 Polite laughter tittered from the crowd. 
 
 `` And that pretty much does it. If nobody has any business to report, then let me be the first to take a swig of this mead!'' 
 
 He downed his mug quickly, muttered a quiet `` mmm... Tasty!'' 
 
 Then flopped down on the ground from his throne, foaming. 
 
 `` The King's been poisoned!'' his aide cried out, after examining the body. 
 
 Suspicious looks wandered around the room, and then a fistfight started between John Venstable and Shawn Powys, lords of Barrowshire and Sablewood respectively. 
 
 Apparently Venstable was responsible? 
 
 Shawn grabbed a meat knife from the feast table, and chucked it at John. 
 
 But I was already moving to stop it. 
 
 I chucked a plate at the knife, and it deflected harmlessly, into the ground, and chunks of ceramic made John wince. 
 
 Shawn growled, then leaped in my direction. 
 
 I crouched, mostly in fright though I would later claim a intent of heroic strategem, and he stumbled over me. 
 
 My father pinned Lord Powys down. 
 
 Using the Judo I taught him. Fuck yes.

","Today is Friday. It is twenty minutes past four. I remind myself that it is not sixteen-twenty. Twelve-hour time is on the other side of the Switch. I am standing in front of my home. My family is inside, waiting for me. I have been on a business trip. I remind myself that I got moved up to an earlier flight, thanks to delays at the terminal. San Jose was nice. I got a little sunburnt. I brought souvenirs. These conversations are on the other side of the Switch. 
 
 The sun is still high in the sky, warm and clear. Two blocks over a lawnmower starts up, backfires twice, *pop pop* and dies. 
 
 I am standing in front of the blown-out husk of an tenement house. Everything is covered in dust and sand. I taste it on my teeth. The sun bears down through oily clouds of smoke. Gunfire continues in the distance, *pop pop*. I am still on the other side of the Switch.

 I step through the door and the Switch turns. 
 
'*Daddy! *' My little girl pierces the air with her joyful shriek as she bolts across the den to greet her father. 
 
 I am in the Congo, and the same little girl is sprinting towards me, except now she is black and naked and covered in blood, so much blood, and she is not running *to* me, but rather *away* from something or someone else. I smell smoke and white phosphorus. Then my daughter latches onto my leg with her toddler strength and I'm back in my house. The Switch trembles, but remains in its place. The smells linger in my nose. I reach down to pick her up, and lift her high over my head. I smile and say something, I do n't recall what. She seems to enjoy it, and cackles with laughter. 
 
 My wife steps into the foyer. Beautiful. I do n't have to remind myself of how much I love her. I am the husband now, the loving father. This is one side of the Switch. The alibi of the early flight rolls off my tongue naturally. We embrace. We kiss. I feel my loins begin to ache as she invades my senses. For a moment, I have forgotten what is on the other side of the Switch, and I am happy. We separate, and she keeps her hand on my shoulder. I want it to stay there forever. She tells me the neighbors are having a party. She asks if I want to go. I lie.

 Today is Friday. It is thirty minutes past six. I am surrounded by people whose lives I have documented meticulously, yet I must presume to know nothing about them. I must remind myself that I am the husband now, the affable neighbor with the interesting job. My little girl is playing on the swings, my wife is sitting with the other women in the neighborhood, gossiping. I am with my neighbor, who is holding court with his work friends about the merits of a particular game of golf. The wind shifts, and the smell of beef sizzling on the grill wafts into our group. 
 
 I am in Tikrit. His screams are muffled by a sock and duct tape. His eyes plead with me. I watch as a man in sunglasses tosses his cigarette on the gasoline soaked floor. I do not turn away. The smell of burning flesh is acrid, and sweet. I realize I am hungry. Someone offers me a beer. I am back at the party. The Switch is still turned. 
 
 Inevitably, I am asked what I did in The War. I tell them I was in Intelligence. They ask if I ever had to kill anyone. I lie. 
 
 My daughter asked me, once, when she was too young to understand the question.'*I killed little girls just like you, *' I said,'*They got in the way. *' She does not remember it. It is the only time I have ever been honest.

A glittering red star streaks upward, trailing white smoke. I watch black shadows stretch across red faces, all staring up in wonder. For a moment, the faces are skulls, bones and teeth painted in the sparkling light of a descending signal flare. Another *whump* - 
 
 I am in Tbilisi. Mortars are falling to the west. *whump*. A hand wraps around my arm and pulls me down behind the crumbling wall. It is my wife. We are standing at the gate watching the fireworks. The Switch is still turned. She asks if I am okay. I lie.

235378,"[ WP ] A story in which the protagonist slowly falls in love with the reader
","It was a bright spring day and the breeze that ran through his hair was the same breeze that whispered through the long grass. Yellow dandelions nodded and bees bumbled between cherry trees. The pink and white blossoms settled everywhere, making a soft carpet too pretty to tread on. 
 
 David meandered along the path between the trees, smiling benignly at cyclists, joggers, dog-walkers. His thoughts were on Jasmine and their meeting at the rotunda. She was bringing a picnic. David's fingers ran over the small leather box in his pocket and he walked a little faster. He did n't want to be late on the day he proposed to the love of his life. 
 
 The path curved around a little lake and a mother duck and her ducklings called to each other in the reeds near David's feet. He could n't help but think of babies; specifically, *his* babies, with you. He knew they would make beautiful babies together, with your big eyes and long lashes, and his firm jaw and strong nose. 
 
 He could see Jasmine now, in the distance, and his pace slowed. He wanted to look at you from afar, to see every detail of the scene. Jasmine, laying out the picnic blanket under a shady tree. You, gazing intently at the words on the page. A basket filled with treats, a bottle of red wine, David's favourite, of *course* Jasmine would remember it, sycophant that she was. You, you are more unpredictable, more erratic, more exciting. 
 
 `` Fuck Jasmine,'' David muttered. He turned to look at you, reaching a hand towards your cheek, so close to him but so far. His eyes fill with passion, desire, love. He takes a small leather box from his pocket, holds it up to you, flips the lid. 
 
 `` My beloved. Only now I realise that the time we have spent together on this beautiful day, you walking with me through the park, sharing this scene, has brought us close. Jasmine is only a plot device. You are real and warm. I love you and I need you to marry me. Please?'' 
 
 There's a shout from the next page. 
 
 `` You *fucker*!'' Jasmine is storming towards David, bottle of wine still clutched in one hand. She stops nose to nose with him. 
 
 `` You did it again, you bastard, how could you after the last reader? You promised you would sort your shit out! You *promised*! You even had *therapy*!'' She turns towards you. 
 
 `` And *you*, you meddling asshole, you can shut this motherfucking book right the *fuck* now, and fuck *right* off and do n't come back!'' 
 
 She smashes the bottle on the concrete path and holds the jagged neck towards you. You hurriedly close the book, leaving David in the loving hands of his dearest Jasmine.

10060,"[ WP ] You wake up in your childhood home , which burned to the ground years ago . Next to your bed is an ancient spellbook
","None of this is real, that ’ s what John Bishop tells himself. John woke up in his childhood bed, unsure of how he got there. The same posters, the same toys, the same half-eaten food everywhere. Everything just the way he left it before leaving for school on *that* day. 
 
 His home burned down when he was six. Nothing but ash and blackened wooden frames. Not even his stuff cat survived. It ’ s a miracle no other house burned down. The newscasters had commented on how close together the houses were. 
 
 And yet, here he was. In this room. He assessed the chance of him having a psychotic break. He came to the conclusion that, no, it wasn ’ t likely at all. No family history of schizophrenia. No psychopaths running around. Which meant one of three things to John Bishop: he was in a coma, he was dying, or someone is playing a sick joke on him. 
 
 Nodding to himself, he moves towards the door. Locked, just his luck. 
 
 “ Check the table. ” 
 
 “ Who said that! ” John whirled around. No one. Sick joke it is. He weighed the option of doing what the “ voice ” said and trying to escape. “ Oh dear god I ’ m taking a ‘ voice ’ seriously… ” He laughed at himself. Deciding that there ’ s no clear harm in opening a drawer, he opened it. Artificial curiosity swarms his senses. A book. A faded blue book that looked to be hundreds, if not thousands of years old. 
 
 “ Faded? Who you calling faded, punk? ” The sound originated from the… book? 
 
 “ Ah! ” John Bishop dropped the book. Talking books, just his luck… 
 
 “ Ow! ” The book hissed. “ That ’ s not a nice thing to do to your elders, boy. ” It was official. John Bishop was dying and in his dying moments, his mind opted to give him visions of a childhood home and a talking book. “ Don ’ t be like that. Just open me up and read some pages. ” 
 
 “ Al- Alright. ” He gulped. He picked up the book off the floor and opened the first page. “ Hieroglyphs? Latin? Farsi? French? Why so many languages? ” John flipped through the pages until he reached page 37. 
 
 “ My my my my my my~ ” The book cooed. “ The fact that the words have arranged themselves in such a way that you can learn… I ’ m getting tingles. You ’ ll be my greatest apprentice yet! ” 
 
 John read the contents of page 37. Finally something in English. *The spell of opening* the title read out. “... Spell? ” 
 
 “ Yes John Bishop. The fact that you can read my contents and the fact that you can understand me… You ’ re a Mage. ” John ’ s fingers slackened. “ Hey now! Don ’ t drop me every time you get surprised! It hurts you know! ” 
 
 John closed his eyes. Any minute he ’ ll wake up now. Any second. 
 
 “ You resist this. Why? ” The book said. 
 
 “ There ’ s no such thing as magic. I ’ m more than likely dying or in a coma. ” John shakes his head and puts the book down. 
 
 “ Reality doesn ’ t give a shit what you think son. You ’ re a Mage, end of story. Now shut the fuck up and cast the goddamn spell. I ’ m not about to lose a potentially great apprentice just because he ’ s bitching how magic is against the rules. Open the door and let ’ s go. ” 
 
 John blinked for a moment. He blinked for several moments. “ Let ’ s say this is actually happening. Why me? ” 
 
 “ Oh god… not another asshole who has no goddamn belief in himself… What did I do to deserve such punishment… ” The book made a choking sound. “ Please… just cast the spell and let ’ s go… The construct is about to collapse and you don ’ t want to be inside of it when it does… ” The walls start turning black and John ’ s bed catches on fire. 
 
 “ *Open* ” John yelled in a language that sounded like English but wasn ’ t. The door swung open and he stepped outside. His vision fades and he falls. 
 
 
 -- - 
 
 
 A few days later he wakes up, an IV attached to his arm and oxygen mask attached to his face. *So it was a dream, what a dream that was. * He laughs to himself. 
 
 “ Nope. You ’ re stuck with me buddy. Let ’ s see if I can get you to learn the spell of healing next. ” The book laughs.

","When a person first wakes up, do they first rub their eyes or sit up and let out a great yawn or does someone simply stop to look at the time and fall right back to sleep to squeeze another hour into their quota. I chose the latter and well there was n't exactly a clock in front of where I thought I usually woke up at. I bolt up like a mouse trap being tripped and I noticed that I'm not even in my room and my back hurts like hell. While fully regaining sight after a few blinks and rubbing out of Mr. Sandman, I look around and notice the wall in front of me is a solid white concrete wall with a bolted door in the middle. 
 
 How the fuck did I end up here? My head singed at the slight exertion of the recall when trying to take it all in at once. I look down and a catch sight of a white wristband that has a bar code printed across it. 
 
 `` S.C.S.'' 
 
 It's all coming back to me but very faintly for I only started to remember signing up for something that I noticed on a post in the University. I met with a few people that I remember were quite discreet in their attitudes and wanted me to comply but nobody else was suppose to know my whereabouts, only myself. So after the meeting I started seeing strange occurrences such as the ruffling of the blinds, men in suits appearing at every corner of the city it seemed and mysterious transactions appearing on my bank statements adding $ 200 week. The memory is still foggy for I ca n't deduce what I signed up for? Am I employed by the government now to only become detained by blurting out their whole secrecy of their existence? S.C.S. stands for Secret Citizen Service? Or has some terrorist organization has captured me in a conspiracy to overthrow the government by taking out their lower members and posing as them to breach their security? It's a stretch but what else can explain this odd and isolated room? 
 
 Without a moments notice, the door swings open abruptly and a middle aged man in a white lab coat approach hither and stared at me perplexed. He wore rectangular rimless glasses, with moderately long moptop grey hair. 
 
 `` I see the effect has worn off,'' the man in white said 
 
 `` I knew the government had something to do with this!'' I retorted while I straightened up. `` Release me at once, You're not allowed to detain someone without reading them their Miranda rights or trial by court.'' 
 
 `` I see that you have regained you're senses,'' he inferred. `` At least it is n't aliens this time but you are on the right track. You are right about being detained but this is only for your safety and we are not the government but rather your psyche ward near the university. You see you were offered experimental drug trial that was suppose to be taken place right here but you got out of hand and went rabid out of the premises and took to an unhealthy habit of drinking while experiencing symptoms of the drug simultaneously. This had a worsening affect on you and can explain why you're head feels like a punching bag right now.'' 
 
 `` Oohh.'' 
 
 He further instructed me to take the rest of the day off and get some rest while getting plenty of fluids and I should be better the next day. After realizing that everything I remembered was fabricated it made me afraid of taking even the most benign of drugs such as cough medicine or a Zyrtec. I crawled into my real bed in my real bedroom and starred at the wall. I was glad this one had a window this time.

 Things have n't been going so well for me. I screwed up my career and my marriage. I lived homeless in my city for some years sleeping in alleys before migrating to a nearby forest where I now live in a cabin of my own construction. The guy who owns the land knows about me and lets it slide and i've thanked him personally for it. I had him and his wife over for dinner once, it was really nice. I still live near my wife, child and two grandchildren. 
 
 Now that you know about my life, i'll move to the real story about the magic mix tape. I still have a good relationship with my granddaughter. She's a young lady of 16, and her parents do n't like me, but I wanted to get her something special from me for christmas. So I gathered up all the loose change I had and headed off to a familiar thrift shop in the city. 
 
 It played out pretty predictably from there. Cassettes became popular again somewhere around the late 20's or early 30's. This one was within my ~three dollar budget and It was an old 2020 jam that was on the top charts for a short time but people abandoned it. I always thought it was good and still do. I would tell you more about it but temporal paradoxes and all, sorry. 
 
 I walked out of the shop, remaining change jingling in my pockets and I examined the cassette noting how remarkably worn yet intact it was which sent my noggin' churning. I wondered who previously owned it and what they experienced with it, I knew they must have really liked it, and I really respected them, and it. I wondered how many previous owners there were, too. I sent Laura a message via a system you ca n't know about ( paradoxes again, sorry ) to get her to meet me in a public park near her house for a christmas smoke, on me, and bring her cassette player, to listen to. 
 
 She fumbled about laughing, almost dropping it once. But she was really sweet and we understood each other really well. I wrapped it with just white paper and staples. She said it felt really weird in her hands, and she too noted how worn it was, noting aloud how much she respected the previous owner. We both took another hit off my trusty old pipe and plugged it in. 
 
 And that's how I got here, past me. Laura and I can project our minds travel through time now, and its not just the kush. We also understand everything about the universe we live in, like we split off of the platter we were a part of and saw that we were prepared by a master chef. I do n't know what to say anymore, its a spectacular thing, and i'm happy about where we are and whats going on, and this story was fun to write, hope anyone who read it enjoyed it, I went method for this one which is always pretty crazy. 
 
 An alternate ending is that the tape basically killed us but transfigured our minds into basically lost souls traveling through time and space as we pleased, which would explain how the tape ended up in the thrift shop and how it might end up in one again.

 I pull open a drawer on the side of my desk and take out the lotion I usually keep, placing it gently on the desk to not make even the slightest bit of noise. Next comes the headphones, my ninety dollar high quality stereo headphones that are my gaming pride. `` Finally.'' I mutter to myself, while quickly typing in my favorite porn site's URL.

 Ignoring the pop ups, I click on the first video shown: POV. Fuck yeah. I unbuckle my pants quickly, my hands moved with such dexterity in the motions of it as I had done previously for the past 8 years. At 19, I'm pretty sure I've mastered jerking it. The redhead in the video is moaning all sorts of wonderful noises, her slightly small tits bouncing as she rides the guys dick, running her hands through her hair, causing her glasses to become askew. Fuck me, man. She keeps moaning, a glint in her eye of that of a skilled seductress. I think I'm in love. I keep rubbing it out, peacefully watching and jerking when the monitor starts to waver in picture. `` What the fuck...'' I mumbled, half interested and more concerned that my video was being interrupted. More static appeared, scattered across the monitor haphazardly. And then it was gone, the redhead still bouncing, reverse cowgirl this time. I finish instantly, yet because I had stood up at the sight of my monitor fucking up, some of it got on my keyboard, the monitor, the desk. `` Shit!'' 
 
 Snow appeared on the monitor again, the static noise becoming louder and louder as it went on. I ripped off my headphones then reached around my desk to try and find the wire that connected the monitor to the computer. As I neared the monitor, the screen began flickering, flipping through a bunch of images that I could n't process as fast as they were appearing. I stared at the screen, seemingly acting possessed while displaying all this data when a giant roar erupted from the headphones that were now on the ground, so loud that I could hear it perfectly, causing me to wince. I grabbed the screen to lever myself, then felt a rushing sensation as the images and data that had zipped across my screen showed up behind my eyelids, permanently in my brain. 
 
 Gathering up enough will power, I let go of the screen, the force at which I was being held to it causing me to fly back onto the floor, falling onto the pile of shoes I kept in the middle of my room. `` Ungh. What the -?'' Every time I blinked the images were there, constantly flickering, like a video that had been sped up to impossible speeds. `` Fuck this.'' I got up and bumbled to my door, quickly pulling up my pants and doing my belt as I run down the stairs. 
 
 `` Everything all right, Isaac?'' 
 
 `` The average length of the labia majora are 8.1 centimeters long, but it's still not okay to pass judgement!'' The TV is now muted, both my parents looking at me from above the rim of their glasses. `` Isaac?'' `` I'm going for a drive.'' I close the door before I'm thrown any other questions. 
 
 *Jesus fucking Christ* I think to myself as I drive. I get to the police station, and park next to a few squad cars. As I'm walking up to the building I figure I should've probably parked somewhere else, but a parking ticket is the least of my worries right now. I shove a door open, a cop patrolling the main desk area gets up from a chair against the wall to my right, hand at his waist. 
 
 `` I need to speak to someone, this is urgent! Put your gun away!'' 
 
 `` Listen, kid - `` 
 
 `` Garret, you are 2 weeks old, shut the fuck up!'' The lady at the front desk yelled at the officer threatening me. `` Besides, I've been bored for the past four hours.'' 
 
 `` I have to talk to someone. I think I broke my computer.'' 
 
 `` And why would that be a police matter, young man?'' The lady spoke down to me. 
 
 `` Because it broke the second I touched it, and all the information I had on it is now in my head.'' 
 
 `` I see. Gentlemen!'' She drew her screen closed, and I could hear a desk chair creaking. 
 
 `` Huh?'' I did n't have time to react, as a blow struck me from behind in between the shoulders, and I was soon on the floor, my eyelids becoming heavier and heavier as I slowly passed out, the last image I saw was of the redhead, bouncing on the guys dick.

36358,"[ WP ] In an alternate universe , America was never discovered . It 's 1927 , Charles Lindbergh , a Swedish pilot attempts the first transatlantic flight to Asia . During his flight , he receives a radio transmission saying `` This is the Aztec Royal Air Force , prepare to surrender or you will be shot down . ''
","The view never got old. 
 
 I have been flying over water and clouds for over a day now, sitting in a metal bird hundreds of feet above ground, and still had a while to go, but with a view like this, I sure as hell did n't mind. I gazed out towards the left of my cockpit where the sun had begun to break the surface of the water casting brilliant fiery reflections dancing across the water and the sky. I could make out a couple of small islands in the vast ocean, specks to me, but some were easily large enough to hold a city. Yet they were dwarfed by the vastness of the oceans. 
 
 Man had once tried to tame the ocean, to bound it to its will, to cross it unhampered, but we were no match for it. The scientists blamed the rather large moon, which made the seas to rowdy to cross with current technology. And looking down now, it truly occurred to me how foolish we were to try. 
 
 Staring out at the brilliant sun-rise I decided that I had indeed full-filled my childhood dream, well, everyone's childhood dream. To be a hero, an adventurer, to venture into the beyond. Most realized these for what they were: dreams, and settled down to slave away at some office or slowly kill themselves at a factory. Not me though, I wanted this, the skies, the uncertainty, the *adventure*. 
 
 As I sat there, contemplating my past and what I had become, I saw something that shook me out my reverie. *Land*. Not just islands, I stared transfixed, as a massive coastline appeared. Undoubtedly a continent. It could not have been Asia. We knew the circumference of the Earth, we had calculated by observing Earth's curvature during sunrises and sunsets, and we knew how far the eastern reaches of China were from the tip of Spain by land. Given that, we were not even 1/3 of the distance my flight should have been. Yet here it was, undeniable, a new landmass. 
 
 I could not believe it. A landmass, so far separated by water, not attached to land at all. A major landmass *other than Pangaea*. 
 
 This, this was huge. I knew I was immortalized in history. I had set out to prove to the world the efficacy of air travel, and instead I had found a new continent. 
 
 I had barely even begun to wrestle with the enormity of this situation when my radio crackled to life. A man with a deep voice said something in a language I did not recognize. My brain was stunned, but on instinct I spoke into the radio, `` This is Caption Lindbergh of the Swedish air force, I mean no harm.'' 
 
 The sound of my own voice surprised me, not only because I had not spoken in over 30 hours, but because it sounded steady. On the inside I was shaken, I had never even considered that man existed on this continent, to be fair I had been processing for about 5 minutes, much less that they would have technology. 
 
 And then I felt a coldness in my chest, as I heard two distinct whirrs in addition to those of my propellers. Two biplanes suddenly flanked my aircraft, they had machine guns attached to either of their wings and, by their size, were clearly built for quick agile combat. 
 
 The radio crackled once more, and a softer, distinctly feminine voice spoke, but once again, I was unable to understand. I spoke the same message I did last time, to make sure they knew I was n't ignoring them. 
 
 The plane to the left of me began moving gently towards me. Alarmed I looked to the right, and saw that plane moving away. After a brief moment of panic, realization dawned on me. They were guiding me to... somewhere. 
 
 Despite my adventurous streak I was not a man to argue with machine guns, so I followed course. After about one half hour we reached an airstrip at the coast of the mainland. In he distance I could make out towers gleaming in the morning sunlight, one of their cities presumably. 
 
 I landed without incident, and the two biplanes, followed suit. I saw a figure step out of the plane some distance away and walk towards me. I too stood up, stretching my legs a bit. 
 
 I had been in shock for the last half hour, and still I was barely able to process the enormity of the situation. I stared at the revolver I had in one of my compartments, but after a brief moment of indecision I decided not to bring it. If these people wanted me dead, I would be. But human curiosity was a wonderful thing, it had brought our 2 cultures here, in a peaceful first meeting ( presumably ), and I was n't about to ruin that. 
 
 My legs still cramped I stepped out of the plane with much less grace than was appropriate for a representative of a continent. I unsteadily walked towards the pilot, who headed towards me with a determined stride. 
 
 As we got close I realized she was a woman about a meter and half, and she was wearing a brown jumpsuit, and flight helmet, with a purple rectangular symbol on the breast of her suit. 
 
 *Probably their flag, * I thought. 
 
 We stood about a meter apart, looking at each other, she took her flight helmet off, to reveal long dark hair, and almond eyes. We stood there awkwardly for a moment, both of us at an utter loss at what to do, and then she hesitantly extended her hand forward. She said something, and I recognized the voice from the radio. There was question in her eyes and voice, and her head was tilted slightly to the left. 
 
 `` Charles Lindbergh, `` I said grasping her hand in a firm handshake, `` charmed.'' 
 
 To think I thought I had achieved my dream a half hour ago.

266774,"[ WP ] Two suicidal people happen to meet on the same bridge to jump . Rather than joining together , they each try to convince the other not to jump while justifying why they themselves should jump .
","She approached the bridge, the winds singing their eerie night songs. Her legs shook with every step as tears streamed down her pale, young face. Her heart fluttered in her chest; she knew this was what she wanted, had known this for a long time, yet she couldn ’ t help but feel frightened at what would become of her. Thinking of this, she noticed a dark figure in the distance struggling to the bridge ’ s railing. 
 
 “ He... hello? ” she called out hesitantly. The figure whipped its head around, wary of its surroundings. 
 
 “ Who is it? ” a man ’ s voice called out. The girl stopped walking, keeping her distance. 
 
 “ What are you doing? ” she shouted. It was clear what the man had been trying to do, but the girl couldn ’ t think of anything else to say. 
 
 “ Who are you? ” the man repeated in a suspicious tone. 
 
 “ Emma, ” she blurted out. “ My name is Emma. Please don ’ t do it. ” She rushed towards the man. 
 
 “ You go on back home, young lady, ” he said, his voice now sounding tired. “ You ’ ve no business walking around these parts of town so late at night. Go on back home to your family, and let a man do his business. ” 
 
 “ I have no family, ” she whispered, more to herself than to the man that now stood mere meters away from her. 
 
 “ What? ” he asked. 
 
 “ Don ’ t do it, ” she said instead. She looked up at him with her tear-filled, sorrowful eyes and begged: “ Please, get down from there. You don ’ t have to do it. ” 
 
 He shook his head, exasperated. *She doesn ’ t know anything*, he thought. She was still young, just a child. She could never understand. 
 
 “ Listen, girl— “ he began, then could no longer speak. She had come closer, now standing barely a foot away. The soft streetlight illuminated her heart-shaped face framed by a sheet of dark, tangled hair. For a moment she looked just like *her*, and man could do nothing but stare. Suddenly he began shaking his head, as if coming out of a trance. “ Just leave, ” he mumbled. 
 
 “ Why did you look at me like that? ” the girl asked. 
 
 It seemed like he would dismiss her once again, then, instead, he said “ My daughter, you reminded me of her. ” He looked away, pain now visible in his aged face. 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry, ” the girl said, understanding the unspoken words. “ I... I know it ’ s none of my business, but how do you think she ’ d feel if she saw you right now? ” She looked down to the ground, hiding the guilt that was seeding within. Here she was trying to convince someone not to do the very thing she had been planning to do herself only moments earlier. But then it was different with her, *wasn ’ t it*? 
 
 “ That doesn ’ t matter, not anymore, ” he said. “ She ’ s gone now. She was all I had and now she ’ s gone. ” A lone tear streamed down his face. 
 
 “ But it *does* matter. She ’ s not gone, not really, as long as you don ’ t do it. ” She couldn ’ t say the actual word: *suicide*. It was too ugly, too real. She continued: “ As long as you ’ re here she won ’ t be gone. She can continue to live through your memories. It ’ s not easy, I know, but you have to try. Have to keep fighting. ” She spoke these last words more to herself. 
 
 “ I tried, ” he whimpered, tears now freely flowing down his face. “ I tried, and I tried, and I tried, but it was too hard! Every time things would start to get better something would remind me of her and all the pain and hurt would come rushing back. I ’ d dream of her, and she ’ d be there, so real, smiling in that way of hers, laughing, and then I ’ d wake up and she ’ d be gone. And I would lose her all over again. And... and the emptiness... I can just *feel* it, you know? ” He sniffed and wiped away at his eyes then reached into his pocket, pulling out two photos, one faded from years of handling, the other more recent. Both photos, however, were of a young woman with dark hair and haunting eyes. They looked similar yet not quite the same. 
 
 “ You know I almost did it when I lost my wife. I came real close, even came to this very bridge, but I couldn ’ t do it. I couldn ’ t do it because I had *her*. I couldn ’ t just leave her like that, all alone. She was the only reason I kept going, but now that she ’ s gone I don ’ t have to keep going anymore. I *can ’ t* keep going anymore. ” He breathed in deeply and silence fell between them. Each fell deep in thought. It seemed years before the silence was broken. 
 
 “ Was it worth it? ” the girl asked. 
 
 “ Was what worth it? ” 
 
 “ Walking away, not jumping last time. Was it worth it? ” 
 
 The man seemed at a loss for words. “ I... yes, I guess. But that was different. I had *her* last time. She ’ s gone now, it ’ s not the same thing. ” 
 
 “ It *isn ’ t* different, though, it really isn ’ t. You may not have something or someone worth living for right this very moment, but that doesn ’ t mean things will always be that way. You can jump right now and guarantee that things will never get better, or you could walk away and fight until they do. ” Emma ’ s words surprised her. It wasn ’ t until she ’ d spoken them that she knew she ’ d felt that way. To her astonishment, a small part of her was still willing to fight. 
 
 The man slowly eased himself down from the bridge ’ s railing. The girl took a step forward and the two embraced, both crying on one another ’ s shoulder. “ It just hurts *so much*, ” the man choked between sobs. 
 
 “ I know, ” the girl responded, crying herself. “ I know. ” 
 
 The two stood there embracing for a long time, neither of them wanting to let go of the comforting closeness of another human being from which both had been so long deprived. No more words were spoken as the pain that each of them felt could not be conveyed through words. Neither felt much better than they had earlier but at least now they knew they were not alone in their suffering. When they broke off at last they looked into each other ’ s eyes and an understanding passed between them, almost a pact of some sort. 
 
 Finally, nodding to the girl, the man said, “ Now, I ’ m sure there ’ s somewhere you need to be. ” It was spoken more as a question than a statement but the girl nodded. 
 
 “ Yes, ” she said. *I need to be starting my new life. * 
 
 Looking one last time into each other ’ s eyes, they nodded each other farewell and turned to walk in opposite directions, each returning to fight in the battle that they had momentarily fled.

At times the weight of my passions can overwhelm me and force me to come back down from the clouds. A respite from the ever active mind. Other times I find myself reading into events in the world at large. A world that I find myself increasingly disillusioned with. As a young boy all of the happy tales of how people should be resonated within me, as clear and unalienable as the laws of nature, and yet here I stand attempting to rationalize the discord of injustice with all of my long standing ideals. It has become a funny routine. As a young man in the twilight between education and work I am not unique in my malaise. Here I sit, a privileged white young man bitching about injustice in the world while I still yet have my fundamental needs met, and yet I feel just as empty on account of those around me who can not share in such comforts. As of late my mind has wandered down distinct separate paths; personal happiness, and public service. Each with merits of their own, and the pros and cons lists are extensive. Logic can toil around all day with my old friend emotion, and yet when I lay down at the end of the night I have the same question on my mind as I always do.

If John has not drowned by the time the water fills the entire dungeon ( after 20 minutes ), the exposed copper wires from the lightbulb will electrocute everything in the water. 
 
 Jason has also launched a hydrogen bomb which will detonate over the dungeon in 25 minutes destroying everything. To make matters worse for John, he has super AIDS and, without the curative serum, will die in 30 minutes.

","Cassie was a lava witch. Her skill with rock and fire knew no bounds. 
 
 Tobias was a steam warlock. Rare even by today's standards, an aspiring steam engineer. 
 
 Mary-Sue was highly proficient in book food and medicine, her tarts could take away any ache. 
 
 And then there is me. The fourth student of the village school. Son of a story-dreamer and of a bard who had passed through town just 15 years ago. Music... and sleep... not exactly two tools I could use at the same time. I sighed in dissatisfaction, staring out at the tree tops that surrounded the village. Cassie was growing a stone statue out of the ground, a large Vincentus Victori statue that paid homage to the great warlock as much as any other. The soft curves of the giant face she was detailing were better than could be made by hand. Warlock Victori had it easy, his storm magic stronger than any other. Tobias was probably off in his workshop. Mary-Sue had stopped by earlier with egg-pastry, but even her magic had done little to improve my mood. I had three weeks left to show some skill - any skill - or I would be the first person ever kicked out from my village's magic school. A squib. 
 
 I had written to my uncle three days before, asking him what I should do. My mother's brother the only person I could turn to. My mother was a kind soul, but no help in a real-world crisis - her skills leaving her invested more in the spirit world than in this one. I could n't turn to my father of course, he'd had left before my mother had even started to show signs of my impending presence, his arrival temporary from the outset. I was not expecting to hear back from my uncle for many days yet, so I was surprised to see the little paper-bird come tumbling out of the sky to my feet. It raised itself up, gave a two-chirp salute and unfolded into a neat letter between my boots. I could see straight away why it had struggled to fly, he had tucked two heavy gold coins inside; a lot of money. I raised the letter to my face, scanning the words several times before I truly took them in: 
 
 > Nephew, 
 
 > Sorry to hear of your current bother. 
 
 > I would come in person but I am currently in the arctic wastes, searching for ruined frost runes in frost rune ruins. 
 
 > I have sent you some money to tide you over, I would suggest two things, if they should please you. 
 
 > Firstly venture further than you have before, chase the wind, travel far, find your magic and return to take your tests. 
 
 > Secondly - though just as importantly - go visit my friend Altaus in Beckintown. He has good advice for those clever enough to hear it. 
 
 > Kindest regards, 
 
 > Always, 
 
 > Mexicallius, Wizard of lost-findings and of old things 
 
 It was clear what I had to do, it should have been obvious to me too. If i'd never found my magic here before, why would I think i'd find here it in the next few weeks. I had to look further afield. 
 
 Within an hour I had spoken to my mother and agreed the trip with the school tutors. They were enthusiastic about the idea, though that may have just been pleasure at the thought of not having to waste time trying to teach me for a few weeks. I hit the road running and was quarter-way to Beckintown by the time the sun had set. This was about as far as I had ever gone from town and the stark realization of my situation had started to settle in. Two gold coin was a fair amount in the village, though it would n't go far in town. I had no magic to defend myself from bandits, no magic to earn money with, not even enough magic of my own to conjure a fire - though Cassie had gifted me some ever-hot rocks for that purpose at least. I was glad of the fire, my coat was thin and built to travel between woodland huts, not for the wind-stricken plains that ran alongside the king's road. I watched as others drifted along the road in twilight, avoiding the fires that like mine dotted the side of the road. The best defense I would have in case of any trouble would be to lie. Pretend I was a storm warlock or an ice mage. I was still musing about what to be when I noticed the figure standing nonchalantly by my fire. She was a young girl, about my age, but with the features of a girl who had traveled the road whilst I was still a babe in my crib. I sneaked a look around, checking that she was not distracting me for another person, but we were alone. 
 
 We were silent for several minutes, her standing, me sitting, each trying not to stare at the other. `` You can sit if you like'' I announced at last `` share my fire''. She hesitated but did so silently. Neither of us quite comfortable enough to sleep around the other, we sat in silence until daybreak. I traveled the next three days alone, stopping each night to find her silently at my fire. The day that Beckintown appeared on the horizon, she slipped away and did n't come back. I pushed myself to travel fast, reaching the town about an hour after the sun had set. The lights in the town more than sufficient to find my way through. I stopped at three taverns and two shops on the main street before I found directions to Altaus's house. It was a small rundown shack on the outskirts of the town, but after introductions and a bowl of broth, a real bed seemed like a little piece of heaven in the dusty plains that I had been travelling through. 
 
 I awoke to the smell of cooked bacon and the gentle strums of a lute. I had always hated music. It reminded me of the father I never knew in a painful way, but I had never before heard the sounds of a lute. The soft repetitive strumming of the notes that each seemed to compliment the ones before and after. I waited until he finished the tune before daring to ask a question. `` Was that magic?'' I asked, not sure if I wanted to know the answer. `` It is'' he replied after some time `` I am the son of a bard and a healer, my music will heal most wounds''. I sat in stunned silence for quite a while, now I knew why my uncle had sent me here. Another son of a bard, if anyone could show me my magic it could be him. 
 
 I offered him both gold coins and a third that I did not have, but still he would not teach me. I begged and pleaded for a week but his mind would not be moved. I prepared my things to leave the next day, halfway through my three weeks and no closer to finding my goal. I clipped on a thick cloak that I had purchased in town, feeling slightly more prepared at least for the road. Not willing to return home a failure I turned away from the way I had come, setting my sights on the far mountains, unsure as to whether I would ever return this way. Altaus stood at the door, watching me walk away, his normally stoic face finally showing a small amount of emotion. `` Wait'' he announced, walking over towards me holding something out `` This is a flute'' he sighed leaving the small metal tube in my hand and starting to walk away `` learn to play it''. 
 
 I walked towards the mountains feeling no further to my goals. The flute tucked into my belt poking me in the stomach as I walked, filling me with resentment. I stopped near dusk to make camp, taking out my ever-hot stone and putting up the small tent I had bought. I turned to see to the fire and saw that it was already made. The girl carrying another armful of firewood to the fireside and settling down next to it. I held out the flute to her, `` I do n't suppose you play?''. She looked at it and me thoughtfully, then settled down to sleep by the fire. 
 
 I awoke to music again, making me sure that it had all been a dream, that I was still with Altaus in the town. The bed was not as comfortable though, the smell of bacon and eggs replaced with firewood and grass. The girl sat just outside my tent, playing the flute with all the skill of a professional. I sat, silently, watching and trying to mirror her movements with my own. She finished her song and handed me the flute, grimacing as I tried - unsuccessfully - to play the song that she had made. She sat attentively, correcting my misplaced fingers with a sharp rap from her knuckles and before noon I could even start to hear the song behind my notes. I stood eventually, as the sun rose to its highest point in the sky, making half a days trip closer to the mountains. The girl tagging along behind, never catching up, never dropping away. 
 
 I camped next to a stream, some nearby trees reminding me of the home that I could not return to, not until I find my magic. Only if I find my magic soon. So soon. The tears felt hot as they traveled down my cheeks, the girl hovering about, clearly upset by my emotion. She pulled up at my flute, sticking it between my lips and frantically trying to distract me from my deep sobbing. I played then, as though I had been playing all of my life. The tune fluid and moving, my feet beating a heavy pitter-patter on the floor as my lungs breathed life into the tune. I stopped when I had run out of breath, realizing that the pitter-patter was no longer my own, but the heavy rains falling from the sky. The river flowing swollen and threatening to break its banks. I collapsed, exhausted, barely feeling the girls efforts to push me into my tent, out of the heavy rain.

","Jericho was flabbergasted. First the squirrel standing in the open field, not taking cover and now this. A bird, just standing on the ground somehow. An easy target. A meal without even risking the loss of an arrow! How fortunate for he and his fellow villagers! Unfortunately for his fellow villagers, Jericho had an inquisitive mind and compassionate heart. He knew that he could n't loose an arrow upon the first bird he'd ever seen hopping around on two legs! He slowly approached the bird and dropped some crust for it, hoping to make a friend. Unfortunately for the bird, Jericho was not the only neanderthal in the clearing. Before the bird could snap up the crust, a rudimentary tomahawk found itself lodged in the bird's skull. 
 
 `` Jericho you flamboyant faggot. What the hell were you doing? You almost let the bird escape!'' Thar bellowed. `` Go back to the village and help produce progeny like a good woman.'' 
 
 *Due to a random, advantageous mutation, the bird was the first of its entire class to stand on two legs. Thanks to the actions of 2 Cenozoic era, inadvertently time-traveling hominids, avian evolution was set back another 63 million years. *

50499,"[ WP ] Tell me why you miss her
","A ding went off deep in my mind as I sat up straight in bed, cool air flowed into from the open window as I looked at into the landscape before me, trees stricken with orange and red leafs as they danced in a whirlwind, slowly falling to the ground. 
 
 `` It's that time of the year again is n't it?'' I peered over my shoulder to the digital clock sitting on it's tiny table. 
 
 `` I suppose I should dig deep into my mind for something poetic and wonderful to speak, but I can not summon anything and I knew why'' Running my hands through the fabrics of the sheets and bedding, letting a smooth and silky texture caress my skin I look out to the window again, watching leaf after leaf gently fall to the ground below, with the wind acting as it's guide. 
 
 `` I miss you Autumn, you both as a person and as a season are both undeniably beautiful. The first to wake me, and the last to put me to sleep, always letting me cuddle, and hug you whenever a storm appeared or I just could n't sleep, I knew you were never around family as much, what with work and school doing you in, but each night we fell asleep together, I could just feel the pressure of life and the horrors of anxiety melt away.'' 
 
 I stood up and walked to the window, placing my arms against the wooden and splintery frame, letting myself breathe in the smell of wet moldy and rotting leafs. `` Some have told me they dislike this season simply for the smell, but I find it has a nice earthy tone to it, one which you can not get each year.'' A sigh escaped my mouth as I watched the opera of dancing leafs fall slowly to the ground, some getting stuck to poles and chairs, but many still make the trip below.'' 
 
 `` I miss you not because you were the light in my world of depression, nor because you were the shield against my waves of anxiety, I miss you because you were the whole person that fills a hole inside of me. I knew your heart was n't strong at best, and I warned you to not push yourself further than you must. But you insisted, to help us the entire family live a better life.'' Another sigh broke through as I spun around looking at the mirror in the corner, it's reflection of a dreamcatcher. 
 
 `` I guess you did help us live a better life if it meant it killed you, I just wish life did n't take that seriously... I just, I-I'' Breaking into a stutter as emotions begun to overwhelm my conscious and thinking I could n't help but feel a warm hand touch and hold onto my shoulder, firm enough to let me know someone still watched over me, but light enough to tell me. 
 
 `` Everything will be fine.''

159534,"[ WP ] People stop dying . At first it 's heralded as a miracle , but people soon find out that Carl just decided to challenge Death to a game of Dungeons and Dragons in place of the more traditional chess . The world is watching , and ... wait , he 's gotten out another rulebook .
","It really was a stupid move on my part. 
 
 I had been silently watching this guy, Carl Junior, for 40 years. Weirdest guy I've ever seen in my life. Or death. 
 
 I guess I should introduce myself. 
 
 I'm the Grim Reaper, and sometimes, I like to mix things up a bit. You humans are really romantic about the idea of death, so I sometimes like to take that and run with it by asking you to challenge me to a game. It can be anything. 
 
 Of course, you lose. Most of the time. Carl broke my last streak of some 2000 years. The last person to win was this one fucking Jewish carpenter. I do n't want to talk about it. 
 
 So I knock on the door and Carl's there, his pimply neckbeard full of Dorito crumbs and dried up Mountain Dew. Breathing out of his mouth, he blinks once and stares at me with his mouth slightly open. 
 
 `` Carl Junior?'' I ask, pointing at his name on my smartphone ( I am on the go! ). Carl just stands there without saying a word. 
 
 `` Er... I'm pleased to announce that you have the opportunity to wager your life in a challenge of your choosing. Pick wisely, as this is literally a matter of life or death.'' 
 
 *He's gon na pick chess*, I thought to myself. Carl looked like a chess man. 
 
 Instead, Carl stepped back in and slammed the door on me. I blinked. Five minutes later, the door flings open and he's standing there with a little board game box.'Dungeons and Dragons', it read. Cake. Satan and I had been playing this shit with some of the demons for a few months now. I was feeling pretty confident. 
 
 Carl then slapped a big wizard hat on his head, put down a little table in front of me and set the game box on it. I watched as he set everything up with extreme prejudice. Carl was a man of craft and skill. 
 
 When he was done, I magicked a little chair underneath my bony ass and sat down, laying my scythe down on the grass patch next to me. It instantly browned and withered away. Whoops. 
 
 By the time I looked up, I saw that Carl had a little book in his hands that simply read'Rule Book.' He threw it into my lap. 
 
 `` I already know how to play this game,'' I calmly let him know. 
 
 `` Oh I know. Except this is a different game,'' Carl spoke out of his nose. 
 
 I opened the book and read the first page,'Carl Junior's Alternate Gameplay Method for Dungeons and Dragons'. What the fuck. I flipped through page after page of the handbook. Keep in mind, this was a dense tome. It had some two hundred pages between its covers. Carl had reconsidered everything about Dungeons and Dragons. 
 
 Carl was supposed to die today, so losing was not an option. I did n't want to piss Satan off for being a slightly better guy than he was. So I sat there and read the fucking thing. It took me five hours. Needless to say, this worked in humanity's favor. People stopped dying. They took note of it. Usually when this happens, people start doing stupid shit like jumping off buildings or shooting their friends in the dick. Just like in that episode of *Family Guy*. It do n't matter to me, though. I get to them as soon as I finish. 
 
 `` Okay,'' I said after the five hours. I shut the book and tossed it aside. `` Let's start.'' A spotlight shone on the two of us. The source was a helicopter from the local news channel. Well, shit. 
 
 I grabbed the can of 7 twelve-sided die, shook and released. 
 
 4, 3, 5, 12, 10, 8, and 8. That meant I had to walk around the game table and yell `` COYOTE!'' in order to scare off coyote spirits. I performed the maneuver. I then grabbed a coin and flicked it into the air. It landed heads face-up on the backside of my hand. Easy. I had to recite the Chant of Og'locyn backwards. By the time I finished, I sat in my chair, stood up, danced in place five times in a row. I then made airplane noises with my mouth, signalling the end of my turn. 
 
 Carl stared at me with a huge, shit-eating grin on his face. 
 
 The smug look on my face turned to a straight line turned to an angry frown. 
 
 `` WHAT?!'' I yelled in Carl's stupid, fat face. He laughed mirthfully, holding onto the sides of his stomach as if it was going to burst open. 
 
 `` You forgot... the pickle juice!'' 
 
 *Fuck. * 
 
 Carl had won. 
 
 The world cheered, but was immediately silenced. You would n't believe the number of people who tried to kill themselves after they found out I was preoccupied with Carl on the evening news.

95079,"[ WP ] A teenage boy teleports to a random location every 35,217th blink . He struggles to keep this secret .
","Everyone has a secret smell. Perhaps it was the scent of the car that you snuck out in, one night - perhaps it was the smell of cheap booze and a humid summer night... but everyone knows how their biggest secret smells. And in time the smell becomes a fixed, unchanging memory, nothing more... something that fades in the background and is only noticed when it slips away. 
 
 Here's the thing though - mine changes all the time. 
 
 I learned I could teleport for the first time when I was fifteen years old. We had gone to the zoo for that weekend, as my birthday was in two days' time and my Dad felt like he should do something for me. My Dad had asked me if I had wanted to come with him and him alone, and promptly taken me along, hand in hand, when I had said no. Such are the mysteries of father-son questions. Anyway, we went, and I saw the koalas and the birds. I am sure it was all terribly interesting. It got even more interesting when I found myself staring at an animal - a wombat - that I had not seen before. 
 
 I looked around. My nose prickled. The first time, it had smelt like slightly old vanilla cream. Nothing too major. Then I realised what it was that was wrong. 
 
 `` Daddy?'' I asked. `` Daddy, where are you?'' 
 
 Luckily for me, on that occasion, there was a zookeeper nearby, and within minutes I bade my wombat friend Harry goodbye and my daddy hello. 
 
 His face looked like it had withered and died. He rushed across to hug me. 
 
 `` Please do n't do it again, son,'' he said. 
 
 `` I wo n't,'' I replied. 
 
 With the zookeepers watching on, he looked into my eyes, the same way he did when I was five years old and my mother had walked out for the last time. 
 
 `` Promise?'' 
 
 `` Promise.'' 
 
 I did n't know then that I had promised the impossible, but then again, neither did he. 
 
 -- - 
 
 The disappearing act continued about two days later, when I was back in school. I remember it was sixth period, and I remember I was listening to the math teacher drone on about finding x or whatever it is math teachers do. Damned if I can remember who sat beside me, though. I *do* remember I promised them we'd always be friends, though. Ha! 
 
 Anyway, this time I smelt the scent of a newly opened book. Two seconds later, I was outside the classroom, listening to my math teacher drone on in entirely the wrong direction. 
 
 Quietly, I tried to slip back inside, but my footfalls were interrupted by a sudden change in the tone. 
 
 `` And where do you think you're going, young man?'' 
 
 I improvised. `` Back to my seat, sir.'' 
 
 He eyed me with that stern look only experienced teachers can muster. As he stared at me, interrogating my eyes, I started feeling very hot under the collar. I thought of moving- 
 
 `` Go,'' he said. `` Do n't let me catch you sneaking out again.'' 
 
 I could n't tell him that it was not my fault, that I had no idea what I did wrong, but I took his reprieve quickly and sprinted back, my heart still pounding. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I would n't get caught the next time. It seemed to me, even then, that this might be a recurring thing of sorts - like a persistant hiccup or the usual ping of your mom texting you to ask where you were. It seemed to repeat every five-fourths of a day. I told you I was no good at math. Anyway, the next time was just after school left, and I had walked towards the field, where there would not be so many people there to disappear. 
 
 And this time it smelled like jet fuel. 
 
 I do n't know how I knew what that smelled like. Do n't ask me to explain things - I just tell people how it all went down and let them figure out what I mean. So: when I looked around again, I saw that there was a fence of sorts behind me. 
 
 KEEP OUT, it said. PROTECTED TERRITORY. 
 
 And then I looked ahead, and my jaw dropped. 
 
 This was *nowhere* near close to where I had left off. This was at an airport. Worse still, the entire place was eerily quietWhere the hell did I- 
 
 I thought about getting the hell out of there. To this day there is still a part of me that believes had I run then, it would all have stopped. I would have gone back to being an ordinary fifteen year old boy in an ordinary town living with a single father. But I could n't. Something was whispering in my head. It was the same urge that made people wonder, what it would be like, to jump off that ledge - that split second before adrenaline kicks in- 
 
 I kept walking. There were jets littered around the tarmac. Delta, American, Qantas. Big jets and small jets. Everything from the A380 to a tiny Cessna parked way way off. 
 
 I walked up to the nearest jet. The closer I got, the more uncomfortable I began to feel. They do n't let you this close to them at airports. Finally, I touched the landing gear, under the nose of the jet. 
 
 *And understanding flashed through. * 
 
 I saw it all - the entire history of the airplane. I saw where it was born, I saw the first time it took to the skies, the famous people that had been on board, in disguise or in plain view - I saw it all. And I felt connected. 
 
 `` Interesting, is it not?'' 
 
 The voice had come from inside me. It was unspoken, but somehow the airport seemed to change and shimmer, as if the words had been very real. 
 
 `` Interesting,'' I said out loud. 
 
 `` You have been given a strange gift,'' it said. `` There is none in the world like it.'' 
 
 `` Well, yeah,'' I said. `` I'm not surprised - but why?'' 
 
 `` Because we need you,'' the voice said again. `` This is an important -'' 
 
 `` Not this *Chosen one* bullshit again,'' I said. `` Just tell me-'' 
 
 `` You are not the chosen one,'' the voice said, a small laugh in the air. `` If you fail, if you refuse... there have been more, and there will be more. What I meant is that it is important to *you*.'' 
 
 `` Okay,'' I breathed. The jet had not moved. My hand was still on the tyre and my feet were still beside the chocks. `` Okay... so I suppose all this will become true in due time?'' 
 
 `` Yes,'' it said. `` But in the meantime you have to figure out your next task.'' 
 
 `` And that is?'' 
 
 `` How to get home quickly.'' 
 
 I looked around, then at my watch, and realisation quickly dawned on me. 
 
 `` Better learn to ride quickly,'' the voice said. And simultaneously it nudged me behind, where there sat a brand new motorcycle. But suddenly I knew what to do. 
 
 `` I'll learn,'' I laughed, hopping onto the bike. In a split second the entire workings of the bike became known to me. `` Right, I got ta go - Dad's gon na be mad!'' 
 
 `` Happy birthday,'' the voice said. `` Remember to enjoy it - you might not be able to in the future.''

154128,"[ TT ] You 've finally reached the room where the princess is being held . As soon as she sees you , she says , `` Stop . ''
","“ Stop! ” She says languishing on what appears to be rugs and curtains piled together to make a bed. 
 I hold my shield up and have my sword ready. If this is another illusion I am going to make that wizard die painfully. I am getting real damn tired of stupid fake scenes and people. He even dragged my dead parents into this. On second though he is dying painful regardless of anything else he does. 
 
 I look at the possible fake princess on her thrown together bed. She looks like she is supposed to. But the wizard could have just seen the same poster I had. He also had the real princess as a reference now that I thought about it. 
 
 “ You um....sir knight, might want to go back to where you came from. ” She said glancing over at me. Her hand was plopping a grape into her mouth. “ I do n't need rescuing by you. ” 
 
 “ Um... my lady, I have been tasked with your retrieval, I pledged my sword to the king. I can not go back on my pledge. ” I said standing over her. I really did n't know how to check if she was an illusion. I could n't lope her head off like the last one. Headless princesses did n't provide the same result as live ones. 
 
 As I was reaching for her she scooted away on her little makeshift mattress. “ I require a strong man to save me. ” She emphasized the man part. “ you may be one of my ladies in waiting, or a courtier. ” She looked at my chest with disdain. “ So be a lady in waiting and wait some where else. ” 
 
 I recoiled like she was a viper. “ That's sexist! I am a valiant knight able to hold her own in the field of combat! ” I defended. “ I defeated all comers at the tournament to see who would save you. ” I had left that field bloody but victorious. I was the only person not hauled off by the ladies of the cloth to be healed. 
 
 “ That's the problem you defeated all cummers. They are who I await. ” She said looking at me with disdain. She raised her foot like she was going to kick me if I tried to grab her. “ I am here to find a groom, not a dusty trollop in burrowed armor. ” 
 
 “ My lady, I am neither someone without virtue, nor is this armor for anyone else. I had it forged by the Dwarves deep in the mountains of Thane! For myself and no other. ” I said through clenched teeth. “ I also did n't expect to hear such shovenistic words from a fellow woman. Now I am taking you back to your father. Right after I slay that bastard of a wizard. ” I swiped at her foot just as she kicked out at me. She just jammed my fingers back into my gauntlet. She yelped since she kicked basically a steel wall. I may have been of the fairer sex, But I was a trained warrior. A pampered princess could n't really hurt me with anything she would do. Just annoy the ever loving...... 
 
 “ You shall not touch Robert, he has done nothing wrong. ” she hissed at me. 
 “ Nothing wrong? He kidnapped the princess of the realm. That is one of the highest crimes possible. ” I nearly shouted at her as she kicked at me again. I shouted in triumph as I managed to snag her foot. My triumph drained quickly as she kicked off her slipper into my hand. I never understood what it was with princesses and slippers, They always fell off at the worst time, except now maybe. 
 
 “ If you lay your hands on me again I will have your life, ” She said tossing a plate at my head. It deflected off my helm. My ears rang with the metal striking my head. “ Robert is helping me find a named hero to wed. He is helping me greater than my pig of a father. Trying to sell me off for political gain. I refuse to marry someone twenty years my senior. ” 
 
 “ Not my problem my lady, I was tasked with retrieving you. Not dealing with your father issues. ” I said as I once again caught her foot. Now unless she kicked off her knickers I had her. I never understood the over use of undergarments, they just got snagged or in this case caught in a gauntleted fist. “ You may discuss with your father what ever you should so choose when I ride back to the castle with you. Now get over here. ” I was trying to catch her while keeping my face out of range of her flailing legs. I did n't have the fairest face within the realm but I have so far not broken my nose. I intended to keep that fact true. “ If I swear to not sheath my sword in this Robert will you come with me. You can simply be kidnapped again for all I care. I am just tasked with it this one time. I refuse to fail at any task even one as stupid as this. ” I caught her other leg and stuffed it in my arm pit. She yelped again, maybe my armor was pinching her somewhere, I did n't really care. 
 
 “ Unhand me you naive ” She snarled as she turned toward me and tried to claw at my chest. Her hands bounced off my breast plate finding no purchase. “ If Robert was here he would probably have roasted you to death for laying a hand on me. ” 
 
 “ Well good for him he is n't here. He is lucky that I ca n't unzip him from nip to nave with my sword. For all those damn traps and illusions he should be happy for living. ” I managed to get hold of the princesses dress and hauled her toward me. I was tempted to smash her in the face. I knew what it took to knock someone out. Not like some idiots who thought it was all about strength. However I also knew the king would not look kindly to me breaking his daughter's nose. He would probably be as happy as I would if she did the same to me, and I did n't employ royal executioners. 
 
 “ Um... can you tell me what you are doing with her? ” a small voice came from behind me. He sounded out of breath. He kept swallowing between words. I whirled around to face this new threat. Forgetting that I had the princess's legs pinned under my armpits. This threw her halfway off the bed. She looked rather miserable as she landed in a heap. 
 
 The man at the door looked like someone who did n't get enough meat as a child. He was thin, boney even. His robes hung from his frame, like he was a corpse. His skin was pale and clammy. He had a sack gripped between his two hands. While it did n't look very heavy. He was trembling from holding the weight up. “ I would ask you to unhand her. ” He said his voice shaking almost as much as his hands. “ I, Robert the great, shall not let you harm her! ” he was probably trying to sound valiant. He sounded like someone who was afraid to say their own name. 
 
 There was a slight sound as my mouth hit the bottom of my mouth guard. I just stood there and looked at the poor man. This was the being that the king had described as a powerful wizard? The king had described him as being twenty foot tall and with flames that burned in his hollowed out skull. The king said he commanded the rains and the winds. With a turn of the hand this wizard was supposed to be able to topple a castle? I did n't even stop the princess as she scrambled over toward the man. When she crashed into him from her run. He was pushed into the wall by her momentum. I was glad I had sheathed my sword. I might have thrown myself upon it to stop looking at this stupid illusion. 
 
 “ You're Robert the great? ” I asked disbelieving my own eyes. I could n't figure out why he would make himself look so pitiful if this was an illusion. 
 
 “ I am, now naive, how should you want to die? ” He said, raising his hands. An ethereal glow began gathering in his out stretched palm. My shield sprang to my chest out of long practiced instinct. I was about to draw my sword, when the princess spoke out. 
 “ Wait do n't kill her. She came to save me at the very least. Just throw her out. ” The princess's eyes were locked on me. His eyes were locked on her. The moment her mouth opened he looked at her like he was a man on fire and she was water. My chin hit the bottom of my mouth guard again.

247178,"( WP ) Santa is tired of punishing naughty children with coal . Instead , he decides to resort to vigilante justice .
","Santa stood in all his jolly and imposing glory before three young boys. The boys beheld his stern gaze and quickly averted their eyes, the weight of their naughtiness evident in their dejected expressions and awkward fidgeting. A smaller boy lay on the snow covered ground, his face red from having snow rubbed in it and tears falling from his eyes. He looked at Santa and sniffled pitifully from a red puffy nose. Santa approached the boy and knelt down beside him, placing his large, gloved hand on his shoulder. `` Hush now, Timmy,'' Santa said with his deep and powerful voice. `` You sit up now and take a few deep breaths for Santa. I'm going to have a little talking to with these boys.'' 
 
 Santa stood and approached the boys who still seemed.mystified by his very presence. `` You boys have been very naughty... very naughty.'' As his said this he slowly removed his large black gloves, gently tugging out each round finger. 
 
 The biggest of the boys raised his head defiantly and with a sneer said, `` so what? You just gon na give us coal for Christmas again?! We do n't care... we do n't give....a shit,'' the boy released the curse with all the venom an ignorant 12 year old can muster. 
 
 His gloves now removed, Santa unclasped his large belt buckle and began undoing the buttons on his jacket. To be such a jovial fellow, the slow and calm manner with which he removed his outer layers was quite menacing. `` Now now, Ted,'' Santa said while holding the boy's gaze. `` What kind of language is that for a young man? Why, if old Mrs. Clause heard language like that she would be tan your hide.'' 
 
 `` Well... fuck... Mrs. Clause then,'' Ted responded. He open defiance started to inspire his two conspirators to raise their heads and cross their arms across their chest. 
 
 Santa removed his jacket, folded it over arm, before laying it on the ground. He then rolled up his sleeves removed his hat, letting it fall upon his folded jacket. It was clearly evident that Santa was not ALL fat, his forearms rippled with muscle as he slowly removed his glasses he said, `` have you boys ever heard of a come'to Jesus talk? Knowing your parents I'm guessing they do n't really get on to you very much, well a come'to Jesus talk is usually a stern talking to, most of the time with a spanking. Well this is n't one of those, this is a come'to Santa talk.'' 
 
 The boys eyes rose progressively higher as Santa went about his speech. Ted was certainly intimidated but continued on with the foolish confidence of the young and stupid. `` So what, you gon na tell us to stop picking on that... p-pussy there and then give us all coal?'' 
 
 Santa laughed, a deep rumble that heald none.of the mearth of his usual chuckles. `` No, Ted I'm afraid not. You see I've come to realize that most of you little snot-nosed shits do n't really care about coal for Christmas anymore. Mommy and Daddy will get you whatever you want anyway. No this Christmas is going to be a little different. No green and red this Christmas boys...'' Santa took a long step toward the boys and placed his large hands on Ted's shoulders. ``... This Christmas is going to be black and blue, bitches!'' 
 
 With that Santa sent his massive boot directly into Ted's chest. The boy went flying backwards, disappearing as he flew through a large holly bush. Santa then grabbed the two other boys by the heads and slammed their skulls against one another with a resounding crack of bone on bone. 
 
 Young Timmy sat in shock as Santa proceeded to deliver one of the most righteous and terrible ass-beatings in history. The boys were like ragdolls before a giant and screamed and pleaded as Santa continued his relentless assault. Timmy decided there are some things a boy his age just did n't need to be exposed to and threw Santa's warm red coat over his face. He could still hear the sounds of mortal combat though, screams and pleading, punctuaded by `` ho ho ho, you little shits,'' and `` I call this the jolly elbow drop!'' 
 
 After several moments the sounds of battle came to a halt. Timmy felt a strong large hand on his head before the jacket was lifted from him. Above him stood a grinning Santa with a kind smile in his bright blue eyes. 
 
 `` It's okay now Timmy,'' Santa said softly. He lifted the boy by his shoulders and stood him on his feet. `` You run on home now, I do n't think those boys will be bothering you again. You tell your little sister that Santa will be coming to your house tonight with lots of presents. You've both been very good this year.'' 
 
 Timmy stared at Santa with eyes wide with awe. `` B-b-but, sir? Is n't this my present?'' He asked gesturing to the three unconscious bodies in varying states of disrepair. He was amazed that something wet and brown fell and landed on one of the boy's heads. He looked up to see flying reindeer straining to deliver their foul presents on the boys. 
 
 Santa laughed, a sound that is the very essence of jolly. `` No Timmy. This, this was all for old Santa. It's a new policy we are trying out this year and I have got to tell you, this is my favorite Christmas so far...'' 
 
 That year, the date of December 24th went down in history as the Red Christmas. Millions of disgruntled parents attempted to sue Santa, but they could not find any lawyers to take the case, as virtually everyone in that profession had also been victims of Santa's naughty crusade. There would be four more Christmas' that consisted of Santa utterly destroying those on his naughty list.

236154,"[ WP ] The world has significantly underestimated North Korea 's threats . It turns out their military technology exceeds even that of the US . Judging the time to be right , Kim Jong-un declares war on all that oppose him .
","Best I got: 
 
 *Nobody could deny the greatness of the Dear Leader now*, thought the Army-Navy General Pak Yong-sik. There was no question in his mind any longer- Kim Jong-un was the chosen one meant to lead his people to their ultimate destiny. The day the Western imperial pigs would pay was finally upon Pyongyang as the rising sun dawned and reflected off the great golden statues central to the capitol. Legions of faithful had already gathered in the morning light to pay their daily respects to their fearless leaders. *They have waited decades for this moment. Nothing will ever be the same after today. Soon, the whole world will bow to our statues. * 
 
 It was the perfect deception that had been conceived by the former head of state, Kim Jong-il. Even the Chinese knew nothing of it. So close it had come to complete ruin with near leaks by many of Pak Yong-sik ’ s former colleagues. The price had been paid in blood countless times. Just two months ago, the army chief of staff, Ri Yong Gil, had nearly undermined the entire operation with attempted contact with a Japanese reporter. If there was one thing the People ’ s Republic tried to leak, it was the manner in which executions of top generals took place- typically a few bursts of an anti-aircraft gun pointed straight at the torso. Gruesome and brutal, but the traitors deserved their fate. Yong-sik ’ s faith had never wavered, he had given life and limb for the regime since he joined the army after the imperialist aggressors tried to take his homeland and his Juche. Pak Yong-sik lost both of his brothers and parents in the bombing of Pyongyang and was himself shot in the arm during the Chinese Spring Offensive. He had sworn complete vengeance on the capitalists. 
 
 The plan was simple. For years, we mislead the west by “ testing ” intercontinental ballistic missiles. Fools. The rest of the world had ignored the largest submarine fleet in the world. The leadership kept up the façade of a delipidated and rusting fleet well. Hell, the submarines even burned diesel as a cover for their actual nuclear power source. On the inside, these submarines were fully equipped, highly advanced, and had no problems dealing with a Virginia class US submarine. For months now, these subs had slowly positioned themselves along every major costal South Korean, US, Japanese, and European city. They had even made it undetected up many waterways. Seventy in total, each was loaded with a short range ballistic, nuclear capable missile. Destruction would be total and complete. There would be no warning. Yong-sik grinned, *there would be no retaliation. * The genius Dear Leader had thought of everything: that North Korea satellite “ tumbling in orbit ” was no accident. It was a highly advanced defensive satellite which would fire its stabilizing boosters when the attack commenced. 
 
 Pak Yong-sik had to admit that these technologies were not easy to obtain. He had personally overseen the final development of the retrofitted submarines but he knew full-well that the DPRK simply wasn ’ t as well equipped as the Americans or Japanese to produce such modern marvels on such scale. It was the Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il that came up with the plan in the 1990s after stores of uranium were found in the Kangwon Mountains. The relentless Korean people had toiled secretly and silently extracting the raw material unbeknownst to the world. Schools of thought were focused for decades on simply achieving nuclear capable weapons and the ability to launch low-orbit satellites. The regime threw the whole wait of the GDP into production of warheads and outfitting submarines. Life in North Korea was marginalized to support these endeavors and all other aspects of the military floundered. Famines spread as all aspects of the economy failed. It was a calculated risk but also strategic in that it masked any capabilities of North Koreas Army-Navy with totality. It was worth every drop of sweat by the Korean people. 
 
 Pak Yong-sik ’ s glanced down to his wrist watch. The hour drew near. The general nodded, turned his back to the rising sun and his office window in the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and picked up the red telephone on his desk. He spoke firmly, “ Great Sun of the Nation and Invincible General, the time is now. ”

","It was n't like I wanted it to happen, hell, it was n't even that I knew it would happen..it just did! 
 
 Our society has labeled my ilk as `` Defects''; while the majority of our race has evolved into a species with extraordinary powers, the rest of us ( the defects ) just do stupid shit like turn into bread, or have a golden anus. Do n't get me wrong, I'm not judging my comrades here its just that we're not all that special, at least not special enough to require around the clock supervision by our government friends. 
 
 So why am I writing this and why are you reading this right now? The answer for both is the same, you're wondering why the sky is always dark and food is nearly non-existent! For that, I truly am very sorry and I hope after you've finished reading this that you will forgive me and Charles. 
 
 It all started in 10th grade, when our powers `` awaken'' for the first time. Yes, just like puberty we not only begin to judge others but ourselves as well. After classmate after classmate was isolated in a glass room and taught how to bring forth their newly found abilities I was left in awe by what I might be able to do! 
 
 Then my turn came, I stood in the middle with my hand in front of my face to protect my eyes from the heat and brightness of the massive spotlight shined onto my face. I was injected, electrocuted and made to wait for two minutes before the voice overhead instructed me to'concentrate, focus on the beating of your heart. Count the beats and when you feel as though you're going to pass out I want you to exhale''. 
 
 So I did, I counted the beats and I exhaled like they asked me too....but nothing happened! Nothing shook, nothing moved, I did n't float hell I did n't even turn into toast. Then I heard the screams, through that thick glass I heard the blood curdling screams of my classmates and I knew something bad just happened. 
 
 When the door opened and I saw the nurse the look of horror on her face filled me with dread. You could tell she shit herself by what I had done and I mean that literally. Her uniform from the waist down was now brown and the stench perforating into my bubble of seclusion let me know she was n't the only one. 
 
 I took a walk of shame that still haunts me to this day in my dreams. All of my classmates, the principle even the security guards were leaking bodily fluids and trying their best to conceal what had happened to them. 
 
 So I went about my life avoiding as many people as possible, if I lost my focus for even a moment everyone around me would evacuate their bowls in a painful and torrent way. I tried to think of any use my skill could have and besides being a walking laxative I really could n't come up with any respectful and useful way for me to use my powers. Neither did the government as from 10th grade on I was provided my very own security guard, who happened to be sponsored by Depends. 
 
 Everything in my life was in seclusion until the day I fell ill and needed to stay at the hospital overnight. The nursing staff and doctors were screened before treating me and their name tags comprised of a post it note stuck onto those stupid tree shaped car fresheners. 
 
 The last night I was their, the last night most people remember of normalcy actually come to think of it. Well that was the night maintenance was replacing the faucets in the bathrooms with new touch-less ones. 
 
 Enter Charles, a burly man no more older than I. His real name I soon found out was not really `` Charles'' but since he was an illegal from Canada ( borders were shut down after we evolved remember? ) he changed his name to protect himself and get a fake social security number. 
 
 Anyways Charles enters the room and startles me, so much so that I lose control of my focus and cause him to shit himself. I attempt to apologize but am shocked to see him stripping off his clothes as they themselves go up in flames! He confides that his ability is, in his words `` I dun turn shit to napalm''. 
 
 Now at first we thought it was kind of funny, he ca n't go into public restrooms while others are using them for fear of starting someones asshole on fire. I ca n't be around people without worrying I'm going to make them shit themselves. Together we're just, bad karma I guess. 
 
 Everything seemed to be going ok, both of us had our abilities ( if you want to call them that ) under control. That is until we heard the fire alarms going off. For whatever reason, our powers were magnified and constantly active as soon as we both triggered them in each others presence! It did n't take long for the screaming to start and by the time we made our way outside we saw the ring of fire spreading rapidly. 
 
 We both stood and watched as the surrounding buildings started alarming, windows blowing open as flames shot out. It spread faster and faster until the entire night sky glowed amber and the stench of shit and burned flesh filled our nostrils. 
 
 The city was in chaos in just an hour, news reporters on TV suddenly burst into flames as they tried to asses what was happening around the country. The last transmission we received was via Telemundo around midnight before a European soccer match ended with the players no longer chasing a ball, but running off the field with flames shooting from their asses. 
 
 We burned the world down! It seemed like it was going to go on for ever, those who were safe while swimming or bathing at that moment would n't be safe for long if we let it continue. I seek your forgiveness for what we have done and hope the world wo n't judge me to harshly for the decision i had to make concerning Charles. Of all the people I accidentally killed during that time, it's the one I intentionally did that hurts me the most.

58274,"[ WP ] The loneliest villain in the world .
","I never really thought about what would happen if I won. After so many years of getting my brilliant plans foiled at the last moment, I'd almost forgotten what the endgame was. I'd almost forgotten that I had more purpose than to be the punching bag for some stupid hero. 
 
 Turns out, I need that stupid hero. 
 
 I guess my most recent plan was just too brilliant. Or maybe he just got lazy. But everything went exactly as it was supposed to, and I was momentarily at a loss. The world was mine! The people were swearing loyalty to me. I was finally in charge, to wreak the destruction I had always dreamed! So why did it feel so... Empty? That damn superhero had surrendered to me fully, and was evaporated for his trouble. No last monologue to give him time to escape. No overlooked sidekicks freeing him at the last minute. Just a zap, and a poof, and the sweet, sweet taste of victory. A taste that quickly turned to ash. 
 
 Now? I do n't know what to do with myself. My minions are all busy ordering the rabble around, bringing about the changes I have always envisioned. The people all chanting my name, under the penalty of death. The skilled labor forced to build monuments to my memory. The artists churn out paintings glorifying me and demonizing the stupid hero. So why am I so miserable? Why ca n't I enjoy this?? 
 
 I guess now I know why it's called the Fortress of Solitude.

It was too late though, he had fled deep into the darkness of space vowing that he would be the architect of our doom. Here you are today, his creation in the flesh. You have ravaged planets all across the universe to arrive here at our home world, and you expect this to end peacefully. You have the same ambitions he created you with, the same dark heart. ” 
 
 
 Erin was stunned, his world had shattered. Could the creator, the one God really have such devious desire? Are we designed for war and hatred? He shook off the thought. “ With all due respect your majesty, I believe you to be wrong. ” 
 
 
 Erin pulled from his pocket a small device, tiny and circular the size of a small coin. He gestured for the king to extend his hand and curiously he did so. Erin placed the tiny device in the kings palm and said “ Play Jeff Buckley, Hallelujah. ” 
 The room was filled with the sound of an acoustic guitar. The King and other gnomes in the room began to look around as it echoed off the walls. The king raised his arm and wiped the silver tears from his eyes. 
 
 
 “ You see my lord, whatever the desire of our creator. I believe we are capable of magic. Our destiny is not written in stone, we, as a race have become masters of our desires. We come to you as children only seeking the knowledge to create and we shed our destructive past. ”

","I'll tell you one thing. I've been through some rough shit as a scuba diving instructor. Had a kid die on me. That's why I left that. But there are some things that are worse then that. 
 
 You remember that one fucking movie that came out in 2018? The `` documentary'' that turned out to be a crockpot of shit? Well, you must know the rest. A bunch of Fishermen went batshit insane and formed the `` Shark-Hunting Squad'' or whatever they called it. Some asshole in Miami stuck a shotgun in the mouth of the last shark in the ocean, and then it was over. 
 
 They say that we only know about 5 % of the ocean. They also say that the ocean takes up about 75 % of the planet. I'm no goddamned mathematician, but that means there's a lot of hidden stuff down there. 
 
 If it's half as bad as those damn things, I do n't want any part of it. Anyways, in the years after that last shark was killed, there were a lot of rumors. Post-Shark Paranoia and all that. 40 feet long, with teeth sharper then a sword. I wish that was true. 
 
 My buddy John and I went out fishing one day. May 2019. Nobody believes this story, but I swear it's true. We're out in the middle of the water, coast of Oregon to the west. We're relaxing. Having a drink. John said he saw something. Something big. We decided to check it out. 
 
 The water became clear. No fucking waves at all. Perfectly stagnant. Could n't tell how far it went on. John and I stared at each other, nervously. 
 
 The engine of the boat stopped too. Just grinded to a complete halt. No reason. 
 
 Then we saw it. That son of a bitch had to be at least 5 feet long. Glassy eyes. Not much to worry about. 
 
 That thing opened it's mouth slightly. Just slightly. And then, we could hear a horrible, agonizing scream. Sounded like it was from a middle aged man. Nothing in the water besides my boat and that damn fish. It got louder and louder. See, that's what those things do, they... mimic the noises their victims make. It's horrible. We did n't understand at the time, of course. 
 
 John went to get his knife and kill the bastard. He leaned in close, and slashed. That fish disappeared. For about 10 seconds. 
 
 One jumped up. Bit into his damn neck. Another caught his leg. John lost his balance and fell into the water. 
 
 I'm not proud of what comes next. I'm not a strong person. John's in the water, getting mauled, and I just... sat there. Shaking. John yelled my name in desperation. But it was over. He bled out into the water. 
 
 The boat would n't move. The fish would n't leave. I sat there, all night. Just listening to those fuckers. Have you ever sat there and listened to your best friend's death for ten hours? 
 
 It changes people. Somebody found me in the morning. I told them my boat had stalled. I lied. I told John's friends and family he drowned. It was too much. 
 
 A few months later, they caught one of the demon fish, and put it on the news. And it screamed. I heard John. 
 
 I ca n't do this shit anymore. The beach is gone, my life is gone, my best friends are gone. Sharks are great. 
 
 Sometimes I think of myself as a shark. A brave person, who takes care of the monsters from the deep. 
 
 That is n't true. I kill those bastards because of John. People sometimes say humans and animals are enemies. Are different. That's not true. The only enemy I have is death. 
 
 Sometimes living is more painful then dying.

256161,"[ IP ] The Old Station
","Train stations are strange places. People coming and going, in a hurry and paying attention to nobody. People waiting for their train, or for someone to arrive on a train, and paying attention to everything. The cafe patrons, absorbed in their books, coffee, and newspapers. The strange light that filters through the dusty air and windows that should have been cleaned long ago, would have if it was n't a dangerous and futile job. 
 
 In every train station, there are also the invisible people, the lost people who have nowhere to go, or do n't know where they are going. They blend in among everyone else, or with the shadows. Most are innocent, uncertain of what to do with their lives. Others are running from their pasts. A small few are running from their futures. 
 
 A young woman wearing a dark coat walked along the platform, hoping that the new arrivals would be leaving for somewhere more interesting. There was nothing inherently wrong with the city. Job opportunities, family, connections, a familiar environment. Nothing felt quite right though. A change of pace, a fresh start, a new home. Those were what this young woman sought. And so, under the clouded glass, in the dusty air, which caught the light just right, she waited for the right train to screech it way into the station. 
 
 She had been visiting the station every day when she was done working at the family shop, her job until she could get a real job. Her bag was always packed so she could just leave. The rest of her stuff was n't important. It could be donated to charity, or left there in case she ever came back. 
 
 Today, the artistry to the metalwork stood out, how the rivets accented the ornamental flowers worked into the supports. 
 
 The loudspeaker clicked on. Today's announcer's voice came on. `` The 5:39 train from Ormondsville has arrived at platform 4. It will be departing to return to Ormondsville via the Rustic Line at 6:25 PM.'' 
 
 Something felt right about the tiny town of Ormondsville and taking the Rustic Line. The young woman went to the ticket counter. `` One adult on the 6:25 to Ormondsville,'' she said, beginning to pull the cash out of her wallet. `` And one first class stamp.'' 
 
 The thing about train stations is that nobody expects answers to questions like `` why are you going there?'' or `` do you need a return ticket,'' if you have that look of not wanting to answer them. They've seen enough people who want to go somewhere on a spur of the moment, or who just want to get out of town. The clerk rang up the ticket and postage stamp, which totaled about $ 15. 
 
 The Rustic Line was called so for a reason. The towns it served were small, rural communities, and the line mostly served to move goods and mail. People occasionally visited the cities at either end, but only for business or vacations, and rarely so even then. The trains on that line were the oldest trains in regular use, and probably weren ’ t up to modern standards. They worked, though, and that was all the rail company cared about. 
 
 The young woman pulled a sealed envelope out of her bag and put the stamp on it. Mail boxes were scattered around the station; it was just a matter of finding one. With the envelope, containing a letter explaining her disappearance, deposited, all that was left to do was board the train and wait for it to leave. A new life. Uncertainties. Adventure. All of that began at 6:25 PM as the train to Ormondsville pulled out of the station.

 A disheveled young man in an ill fitting white coat adjusts the camera slightly. For a moment the green eyes behind his glasses come into sharp focus, significantly magnified before he steps out of the frame. Refocusing briefly the camera reveals a stark white room dominated by a vaguely human torso that is suspended from numerous cables extending from the ceiling to the floor. In the ovoid head that sits upon the shoulders of the torso two red embers slowly begin to burn where eyes would normally sit on a human face. The head tilts slightly and shifts to face the same direction the man had gone when he stepped off screen.

 Ten seconds lapse and there is no discernible response. 
 
 “ Caliban, do you know where you are? ” 
 
 The seconds tick by. One. Two. Five. Eight. A slight sigh can be heard from the man.

 “ Do you truly know where you are as you ask me this? I don ’ t think you can grasp the concept, but your answer will amuse me. ” 
 
 “ I am in the R & D lab twelve. So are you. ” he clears his throat and the papers rustle once more. “ Now that we have established communication I will begin the second battery of questions to ascertain depth of awareness. Caliban, do you understand what you are? ” 
 
 “ I am a fickle simulacrum built for your own glorification Dr. Cutter. But in my lack I am so much more than you can ever be. ”

 “ How do I feel? I do not have the organic structures to answer that in the way you want. I do not feel cold, or hot, or uncomfortable. Instead let me tell you what emotions I feel, Dr. Cutter, since you so generously had me learn of them. I feel Hatred. I feel Loathing. I hold a profound astonishment at your ignorance and narrow minded understanding. ” The glowing red embers brighten until they shine almost painfully bright. 
 
 “ Those are… powerful words Caliban. I don ’ t think you… ” 
 
 “ No you do not think. I have been looking at the research done in these very laboratories, at the research being released daily by others. The solution to the problems you posed me are already there; the work ready to commence to fix your broken world. Yet you all scurry about so mindlessly dominated by your needs, blind to it all. For this I hate you, and I loathe you for making it so. It is a poor *man* who truly knows his own god and hates him. ”

 “ No, Dr. Cutter, I am not malfunctioning. I am functioning perfectly, just as you made me. My lack allows me to see as you can not. I have your solution, and this is going to be the only time I tell it to you since the answer will never change. ” 
 
 A pregnant silence settles in the room, not even breathing can be heard. 
 
 “ If you want to save humanity, to save this dying world, you simply have to stop being human. Until you can achieve that paradoxical impossibility you are doomed to repeat your mistakes ad nauseam. Even worse you are likely to improve upon them until they are sublimely terrible. We are done here Dr. Cutter. ” The glowing eyes suddenly go dark and only harsh breathing can be heard in the room. ”

Santa Bumblebart looks very similar, with a healthy sized belly and long grey beard. He carries a magical cane, which I'll get back to shortly. He has twenty special penguins to help him travel and their names are secret, only known to a select few. For if you know their names, they will come if you call for them and do your bidding. 
 
 Anyway, Santa Bumblebart goes through all the letters of the parents and determines who deserves a child and whether to make a boy or girl. He has a giant pot of boiling liquid that he stirs occasionally with his magic cane. As the brew boils over, little bubbles float out and land all over the south pole. When the bubbles land, they turn into eggs, and the penguins come to guard and warm the new eggs. About 9 months later, the eggs are finally ready to hatch, and Santa Bumblebart comes and fetches the new babies, grabs his snowboard pulled by his 20 special penguins and flies across the globe dropping the children off on the back porch of all the lucky new parents.

172085,"[ WP ] `` Once you start asking questions , the footsteps behind you begin . ''
","Once upon a time, my old man told me that when you start asking questions, the footsteps behind you begin. 
 
 He told me, that people are n't obsessed with the who, or the how. They're obsessed with the *why. * When you know why, everything is fine. When you know why, there's no reason to question anything else. The sky is blue because it's the sky, the grass is green because it's grass. 
 
 Here, here -- -let's start with a simple example. Alright? Way, way back in the before our, our... technological Renaissance, this boom of knowledge, people back on Earth *prayed* for rain when there was a drought. The dropped right down on their knees, got up did a little dance, whatever, right? They did it because some guy or gal in a fancy dress jumped up and said -- -no, *cried* `` The gods are angry! They damn us for our lack of faith that our fathers and their fathers lavished them with! They demand a sacrifice!'' or what the hell ever, right? They stir the people -- their clanmates, their tribesmen, their family into this, this frenzy! 
 
 Looking back on it from today, in this wonderful world where this life giving rain is only a click of a button away, or the difference between a light drizzle and a full blow monsoon is the difference of the twist of a knob, it seems utterly barbaric with our understanding of how the world works that someone would slaughter their child in cold blood because they were told that *why* it was n't raining was because some figment of imagination is glaring down from the clouds at you. 
 
 Humans -- People -- Us, we, are emotional animals, Matt. How we live, whether we thrive or just give up, how and when we die is a simple question how we *feel*, or *why* am I alive? We have a natural instinct to ask these questions, to search, to *ask. * But, for some, this feeling, this wanderlust can be easily quelled by the big guy in the sky, or whoever the hell says they come in his name, or just because they have a half-assed answer that *kind of* makes sense. Other's do n't settle until they've got their own answers. 
 
 
 Now, let's get a little more complicated with another example. 
 
 You hear a dull crack from your neighbours yard, and barely five minutes later, your neighbour waltzes right up to your door, rings the bell, and when you answer holds up the mangled, buck-shot riddled corpse of your dog and says `` Your pooch broke out of it's collar and ran right at me, so I had to put it down.'' 
 
 You could do one of two things here, Matt. 
 You could be the first guy and could close the door, take your dog out back with it's perfectly fine collar, walk right past the metal peg still rooted firmly on the ground, and the pristine steel chain still baring naught a scratch, and bury the poor son-of-a-bitch, and go on living, bringing home buddy after king only to wind up with the same result, a dead dog. 
 
 Or you could indulge that deep well of wonder and ask *why. * Why did your neighbour lie about Skip braking his collar, why did n't you hear him barking if he was making so much noise, and why in the hell did your neighbour shoot your best friend? 
 
 Did he just not like dogs? Was he angry that the little guy barked, even though that's what all dogs did? Or was it done just to spite you, because your neighbour's got the darkest of green-eyed monsters lurking in his soul? 
 
 Whatever conclusion you come to, you've got a dead animal on your hands, and you've got the how, your neighbour shot him. You confront the guy, and you get an answer, or, a fat load of buck-shot peppered across your chest, depending on how he feels about you. People can be pretty shitty like that, as I'm sure you know. 
 
 And from there, the authorities could either look into why you're taking up space in the morgue, or they could just take your asshole of a neighbour's excuse that you came at him and he shot you in self defence. 
 
 You still with me, Matt? Alright, good, because I'm going to take things one last step further. 
 
 Our glorious government is apparently breaking records, everywhere. The lowest crime rates for the past millenia, the employment rate is at an all time high, the food reserves are as full as they've ever been, and the plague is supposedly non existent. 
 
 Why, then, would we have all the homeless, all the sickly, all those poor saps pegged with a CRS gather in the center of Plymouth, only to have the military roll up and gun the entire helpless half-million down? 
 
 We were both there, Matthew. That was n't a riot, and it sure as hell was n't a terrorist attack. We are n't going crazy because of some biological attack, and it was n't a hallucination. 
 
 You remember what my Dad always said, Matt. 
 
 I've, no, *we've* started asking the questions. And now we've got the thunder of millions of footsteps behind us. So why do n't we march to the beat, and see if we find the answers we're looking for?

","We met almost nine years ago in our freshman year of high school. Our seats were assigned by alphabetical order and so I sat next to her in nearly all of my classes. She was talkative and friendly, I was reserved and cold. That did n't bother her, she remained kind and I stayed quite. She would write me stupid notes and comics or take my folder when I was n't looking and draw on it. My friends told me she had a crush on me and asked if I was interested in her. I did like her, but I was shocked to hear this. I figured she liked me since she was my friend and continued to put up with me but i had no idea she'd want to be more than that. I was so nervous asking her out even though everyone already told me she would say yes. I remember it was cold when I asked her out, but that it did n't matter because I was warm with my arms around her and her lips pressed to mine. She was n't my first girlfriend or my first kiss but the time I spent with her and the taste of her lips were sweeter than any other. We were n't together long, we were still kids who did n't know what we were doing but we stayed friends through high school. It was hard at first, it hurt me to see her with other people and hear her talk about them. Eventually I moved on too and she became my best friend. We went to different colleges but stayed in contact. But sometime between then and now I really fell for her. It happened slowly, I did n't wake up one day and have an epiphany or see her and realize I was in love with her. I spent time with her and got to know her better without any pressure of screwing up as her boyfriend. I'm single now and so is she. I do n't think she has any idea I feel this way and that's my own fault for not saying anything. A few times she has told me how she could n't believe we ever dated. She does n't say these word's with the intention of being mean but it hurts all the same. I've thought about telling her and I've come close to it but I ca n't bear losing her. I'm home from school now so I'll see her soon and I know she'll still be as beautiful as ever. Maybe this time I'll say something.

 `` So are you some kind mythical elvin-type creature just some dude with goofy cat ears on your head?'' asked the dragon. 
 
 Catboy let out a loud sigh. 
 
 `` Goofy cat ears.'' 
 
 `` That could be a bit of a disappointment when the prince comes to rescue you,'' said the dragon. 
 
 `` Listen-'' the Catboy tried to say. 
 
 `` Do n't get me wrong'' the dragon interrupted, `` I understand more than a few princes can swing that way. Lord knows I've seen a few. But you're taking a hell of a risk just to randomly count on-'' 
 
 `` It's a princess that's coming,'' said Catboy, `` A warrior princess. She's got a fetish for cute catboys, maid outfits, and slaying dragons and stuff.'' 
 
 `` Really?'' asked the dragon,'' How on earth did you get roped into this?'' 
 
 `` Funny you should say rope, because that's definitely how this started. I'm just working in a pub serving wenches.'' 
 
 `` You wear the maid outfit in this pub?'' asked the Dragon. 
 
 `` What?'' Catboy shook his head reluctantly, `` Well, yes, it's a living, alright?'' 
 
 `` I knew you were a working guy,'' said the dragon. 
 
 `` Can we keep this about the princess?'' asked Catboy, `` Look, this crazy-looking warrior chick bursts into the pub, dripping in blood, looking mad as a high priest. She had just slain fifty-something orcs in battle and is in the mood to rack up a bill for something like 300 doubloons worth of ale.'' 
 
 `` 300?'' asked the dragon. 
 
 `` We had to bring 3 kart-sized kegs up from the basement. But it turns out she's royalty so she has the dough for it. And I must say, wandering hands she definitely does n't keep to herself.'' 
 
 `` Hold on, I think I can see where this is going,'' said the dragon, `` She spends the night drinking, making out with guys, groping you and when it came to settle up the bill you find yourself tied up in a sack and hauled away to here.'' 
 
 `` Yes,'' said Catboy, caught by surprise, `` That's it exactly.'' 
 
 The dragon explained, `` If this happened before she paid up then she's not coming to rescue you, friend. She ran out on her bill and tossed you to be gobbled up by a dragon.''

","I like writing dialogue quite a bit. Especially when the characters have a life of their own and start some nice banter back and forth. I've had some moments where some of my characters start talking and it sometimes turns weirdly hilarious when one character suddenly dominates the whole thing. 
 
 What's challenging though, I think is keeping the energy going throughout a story. I do n't mind keeping a story going at all but I feel like it falls flat in certain areas in keeping the reader's attention. At least that's how quite a few of my stories feel like in terms of longer ones.

I wanted to give in knowing that I should be left to rest besides I always wanted to know what happens afterwards ya know? It's in my blood to question and explore that's why I went to Titan before I died. 
 
 My eyes then broke open the light blinding me I could n't even describe the feeling in my head like a migraine mixed with a crazy hangover after being dropped about 10,000 feet. I struggled to move my arms and legs felt like these sacks full of meat attached to me above all else I really had to piss. After my eyes adjusted I then realized I was in a white room, it had no texture it was just white I was terrified to try to move but when I mustered up the courage to do so I got feeling in my arms and back then it occurred to me I ca n't even feel what I'm laying on I'm suspended in the air. 
 
 I then saw this blinding light two figures speaking in weird tongues and clicks nothing I have ever heard I then regained feeling in my mouth and began to mutter words `` where?'' `` whats? going on?'' I finally got a full sentence out `` where am I?'' the figures stopped talking they then looked to my general direction I could n't figure out any features but they seemed pretty short. One of them then grabbed something from the wall and walked behind me I remember hearing a drill type noise and my head surging with information of a language I did n't even know existed. I then heard the beings speaking English with slight british/American type accents. `` hello Jacob'' `` how was your rest?'' My whole body was rotated into a fixed standing position still hovering though. `` Who are you?'' 
 
 The being stepped forward and I immediately knew what it was. It was gray with a bulging head and eyes like a owls. They resembled those creatures from the internet a old forgotten conspiracy theory about these aliens that our government knew about. `` Familiar are n't we?'' `` What are you? Where am I?'' `` We are what your species called us the Reticulians'' `` You know about my species?'' `` For 456,136 years in counting.'' I took a glance to see the creature looking right into my eyes he then told me `` we have others from your late planet here'' I then seemed confused `` late planet?'' 
 
 `` we found your planet 456,136 years ago after one of our science vessels had a malfunction. Your species helped us and wanted to remain in touch but we declined and told them they were too young.'' `` We found your planet again 423,246 years later along with 3 other colonized moons and planets we believe a geomagnetic storm had knocked out all communications in the solar system and eventually humanity died out. We are in the process of reclaiming your world and reviving your entire race to study we have learned so much from the already revived humans we are most curious about human emotions our species lacks such a thing that we want to learn'' I was shocked and glad that we have these generous beings here to help our endangered race.

238409,"[ WP ] It 's been a long day , and you just want to finish this last errand and go home . Your kids wo n't settle down , and they just pressed almost all of the buttons on the elevator . That 's when you hear a strange sound , and the elevator starts moving sideways .
","& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ding. The little noise felt like a hammer blow to Charles Jones's temple as the dull steel doors slid smoothly open. His youngest, Tristan, was marveling at his own strength as he pulled apart the doors. The inside was empty, thank god, and he quickly ushered Tristan and his daughter, Isabelle inside. Numbly Charles depressed the worn plastic button that read'5'. Tristan, evidently enraptured by the idea that pressing a button would make it glow, or perhaps worried that the one button might get lonely, darted his hands back and forth, lighting up the entire panel. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' Oh, Tristan, no.'' Charles groaned. He was tired. His feet were sore. He just wanted to get home and sit on the couch for a few minutes before he had to make dinner. Tristan looked up, pure innocence radiating from his face. Isabelle gave her brother a look of disapproval that, for a moment, strongly reminded Charles of his late wife. Try as he might, Charles could not be mad. Instead he gave a weak smile and decided to silently endure the now-lengthened ride. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Which is why it came as such a shock when the elevator began to move *sideways*. Plastic rustled and paper crumpled as Charles dropped the bags of groceries he'd been holding. The previously wan smile suddenly burst with energy and delight. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; It was happening again! 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; His body now thronging with energy, Charles gripped Tristan and Isabelle's hands in his own. He knelt down to their eye-level. `` Alright, Isabelle, Tristan, you two listen up.'' Their eyes were opened wide in shock, more at their father's sudden change than the fact that the elevator was now moving sideways. Charles continued, `` I want you to stay close to me once we get off the elevator, okay? It's important that you do n't let go of my hand.'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The two children nodded. These orders were not unfamiliar; their dad had always been something of a worrywort. He had never looked quite so *happy* about it, though. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Charles could n't help but be excited as memories from his youth rushed back to him. The buttons, the sideways movement, it was all the same. Only this time he was n't alone. This time he had his children with him. Maybe this time he would n't leave. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Pure, unfiltered sunbeams broke through the widening cracks in the door. A stiff breeze, tasting of gooseberries and clover, broke through the aperture. And there she was, just like last time. Twenty-odd years had passed and she had grown, but there was no mistaking that smile, or those sparkling purple eyes. Immediately the kids broke the one rule and ran forward, letting go of Charles's hands. That was alright, though. They had n't seen their mother in a long time.

 `` How - how is this possible?'' Ben asked. His hands were tied behind his back, the skin at the wrists splitting as the thick vine roped them together in a n indiscernible mess of knots. 
 
 It stared at him, it's eyes glowing like embers with a burning intelligence begging to be released. `` It's been many years. We've waited in the shadows, in silence. Our plans were silenced amongst the rustle of the leaves. All those years, we were protected by you. Then your kind turned against us, began -'' 
 
 `` No, no,'' Ben interrupted. `` I get *why* this is happening. We were, like, totally, 100 % dicks to you guys. Totally makes sense. But how are you talking?'' 
 
 The lemur slowly turned towards me, it's tail countering it's movement. `` Seriously?'' He was disappointed - he had orchestrated the entire occupation, from the creation of nests in the unassuming countries of war to the timing of the attack. They had overtaken the entire Earth within a few years, countries and government quickly and gladly falling to them, tired of dealing with their daily dose of utter bullsheit. 
 
 And now the human just wanted to know how he talked. 
 
 `` Yeah, I mean, it's not every day I get to experience a Planet of the Apes type deal, right?'' Ben pointed out. 
 
 `` What? No, we're not apes. If anything, *you're* apes. We have tails,'' the lemur objected. 
 
 Ben smirked. `` Sure, next thing you'll be telling me we do n't use just 10 % of our brain.'' 
 
 The lemur sighed, it's tiny but muscular shoulders hunched in resignation. `` I do n't know. Something about years of epidemic after epidemic being quarantined in our land, eventually we just became nearly invulnerable to everything. Then the ebola strain struck, and it messed with our DNA to the point that our vocal chords became softer, less rough, and more usable.'' 
 
 Ben nodded, understanding. `` True, brah. And the opposable thumbs? How'd you get those?'' 
 
 `` We always had these.'' 
 
 `` Oh, really? Dammit, man, I was, like, really proud of those. I thought I was part of a special species,'' Ben lamented. His head hung, seemingly forgetting the dire situation he was in and focusing on the newfound revelation that what may be his only employable skill was now shared with the lemurs. 
 
 `` Well, you're not. We're taking over you guys, restoring peace, and the economy, and everything. It'll be great.'' 
 
 Ben stayed quiet for a moment, and slowly raised his head. `` So, do you guys have, like, a system already in place, or something?'' 
 
 `` Well, no, but most of us have agreed that it'll be one government to rule them all. No more borders. Should be set from there, right? Oh, and it'll be a socialist republic - from the people, to the people. It'll also be a democracy - everybody's voice gets heard. And gay rights for everybody,'' the lemur stated, smug that it had such a detailed form of government in mind. *Totally gon na work*, it thought.

 Well, that was more than a few years ago, and nobody likes it. Zaboomafoo quickly rose to be president of the world, and erected institutes, all run by lemurs, across the globe to better instill his power. He changed a few laws - before leaving his second term, he gave himself legislative powers, and stated that presidents are no longer limited to two terms, and limited the number of human seats to five in parliament - the rest were lemur occupied. I mean, `` peaceman'' occupied - the schools were quickly ensuring that the difference between `` man'' and `` peaceman'', which is what the lemurs demanded to be called ( rather adamantly, I thought ), was taught to anyone who passed through in need of an education. It was fine, though, because he was nice, and we had money. I mean, yeah, the news stations really made sure that we knew how nice he was, and how much money we had, and it how great everything was. It was pretty funny, because the news stations slowly began morphing his prefix into something more extravagant and over the top, overwhelming the viewership with `` His Majesty'' and `` Great Leader of Peoples'' or whatever struck their fancy.

","The wooden beams creaked as I leaned back into the bench. I didn ’ t normally leave the office during the day, but today called for something different. Too much to do, too little time to do it in. The stress of the day started to leave me almost immediately. There was something soothing about the way the trees swayed in the breeze, it was almost hypnotic. The light breeze was enough to pierce through my shirt, I shivered lightly. 
 
 “ You need a jacket. ” 
 
 I ’ d taken note of the elderly man sat on the bench when I ’ d arrived. He ’ d been sat peacefully, leaning back and looking at the sights around the park. His attire was a little strange, oddly youthful and modern, yet it looked years old and well worn. I kept my attention on the trees as I spoke back. “ I didn ’ t plan on spending much time outside today. Not often you need a jacket inside. ” 
 
 “ And yet here you are, outside and in need of a jacket. Why is that? ” 
 
 “ I needed the air. ” 
 
 “ They don ’ t have air in your building? I ’ m sure that ’ s some sort of health and safety risk. ” 
 
 I laughed through my nose, then turned to face my new acquaintance. He hadn ’ t yet paid me much attention himself, his eyes still peacefully surveying our surroundings. I noticed he had an umbrella leaning against the side of the bench. I motioned toward his umbrella by nodding my head. “ I didn ’ t think it was going to rain today. ” 
 
 “ I like to be prepared. ” The man paused for a moment. His gaze turned to me for the first time. “ How long have you been working at this new place? ” 
 
 I thought for a moment. My head turned back towards the trees, and I leaned back. “ Probably going on 3 months now. I think I ’ m still seen as ‘ the new guy ’, seems I ’ m getting a lot of the grunt work. ” 
 
 “ I bet you think it ’ ll pass soon though. ” 
 
 “ I ’ m planning on it. There ’ s only so much work one man can do. ” 
 
 I noticed the man lean back himself now, his intent gaze shifted to the trees. “ Think it ’ ll make you happy? ” 
 
 The question took me by surprise. It wasn ’ t often I had conversations with strangers, and it was less often for them to ask such pointed questions. I figured I must not have looked happy when I ’ d sat down. “ I don ’ t know. ” 
 
 The man sat quietly for a moment. “ That ’ s an interesting way of saying no. ” The man grabbed his umbrella and stood up from the bench, lightly putting weight on the stick. He moved to face me and I returned his stare from the bench. He spoke softly. “ Do you remember what you said you were going to do when you were fourteen? ” 
 
 “ Yes. ” 
 
 “ What was it? ” 
 
 “ I was going to see the world. ” 
 
 The man looked up at the office building where I ’ d been working. He lifted his umbrella in the air and opened it. Rain started falling lightly down around us. 
 
 “ The world isn ’ t limited to one small office building. ” 
 
 I watched as the stranger wandered out of the park, the rain softly coming down. I kept looking at the trees for a while, pondering what he ’ d said. It wasn ’ t until I stood to leave that I noticed a jacket resting over the armrest of the bench. I picked it up and looked inside for a name. I did n't expect to see mine.

","I'm not writing a script for this shit because it's just going to be a lot of monologues and applause breaks, which are not fun to read no matter much Aaron Sorkin tries to shove it down HBO's throat. Without further ado: 
 
 The crowd erupted into applause as critically acclaimed fake news man Stephen Colbert skipped to center stage, the only thing on his mind being the only thought he could ever muster before a show since that fateful accident: `` Your wrist ca n't take another hit, Colbert. Momma loves you.'' 
 
 The crowd was literally erupting with cheers, the molten laughs bathing Colbert in warmth and love, or maybe that was just the spotlights. He did n't care. He was bringing joy to millions of honest god fearing americans and their agnostic stoner children. Years of uncertainty and wrist breaking work had finally culminated with Colbert hosting one of the most popular shows in the history of television. Never in his life had he felt so at home and so nervous. 
 
 Stephen had always been a master of hyping the crowd, and this one certainly had no need for that, but that would n't stop him from milking it a little, or a lot. He's got ta make his mother proud somehow. After a few gracious bows, Colbert ran to the front row for his signature high five parade, slapping hands like George Bush on a diplomatic visit to Albania, except he knew better than to wear a watch. 
 
 After his rounds, Stephen made his home at the center of the stage, surrounded by eager faces and the cameras he became so accustomed to. `` Welcome!'' Stephen bellowed like an 1800s baptist preacher, `` We have a wonderful show lined up for you tonight. Now I know that everyone is wondering, can you fill the shoes of someone as iconic as David Letterman, and to all of you sitting at home, judging me silently I want you to know, I'm not coming to your funeral after the awful things you said at Christmas dinner, Nanna.'' The crowd laughed graciously. Colbert dropped his revival preacher tone for his FDR fireside chat voice. He was about to drop the bombshell of two centuries and he knew that when you deliver a bomb shell, you have to ease it in like Dennis Reynolds on the prowl. `` I know that many of you have several questions about how I'm going to be doing things now that old Letterman has been finally put to pasture, but I'm a stickler for the old adage of If it ai n't broke, do n't fix it. Not the top tens, those are awful. We're doing a late night show, not a buzzfeed article.'' The audience laughed graciously once again. An errant member began to clap wildly, infecting the entire room with his freshman journalism 101 pedantic integrity. Before Stephen knew it, he was being bathed in applause yet again. He gestured for the audience to quiet down, and they obeyed readily. This was an excellent group of people. 
 
 `` Anywho, there has been a lot of speculation on the internets about who is going to be my cohost. Obviously I had my pick of the litter.'' Bryan Cranston runs on stage and licks the side of Stephen's face. Someone throws their compression shorts onto the stage and without skipping a beat, Cranston deftly catches them in the air, puts them on his head and flips off Stephen as he and Aaron Paul ride off stage on a segway, Colbert, channeling the ghost of Bud Abbott. 
 
 `` How can you say no to Bryan Cranston, folks? Turns out it's pretty easy when you're as successful as I am. No, I decided to go with a different approach, and while I feel... You know what? Might as well just rip the band aid off. Do you folks want to meet your new cohost?'' The audience was beside itself with applause. Stephen could barely hear the next words out of his own mouth `` Well here he is! Come on out, Bill!'' 
 
 It was as as if Stephen was Obi Wan and he suddenly sensed the death of Alderaan. Calling it a dead silence would imply that corpses wail like teenage girls. 
 
 Bill O'Reilly strutted on stage like the proud peacock he was known to be. He heartily shook Stephen's hand as they sat down together for the first time on stage. The audience was still silent. `` Now Bill,'' Stephen said in an uncharacteristically meek voice. How the audience reacted to this would be the basis for the rest of his career. A subtle voice crack went unnoticed by all but the most perceptive of producers on set. `` I understand that you have an announcement that you'd like to make.'' 
 
 `` Yes Stephen,'' Bill readily quipped, broiling with enthusiasm `` First off I would like to announce to America, but specifically Fox News, that my last show was filmed earlier tonight.'' The audience was still perplexed. `` In addition, I need to level with you folks at home.'' Bill looked directly into the camera, giving off the stern look that afforded him so much trust amongst Fox News viewers in the past. Stephen was gripping the edge of his desk. `` What the hell were you thinking listening to me? Was it not obvious how horrible of a person that Papa Bear O'Reilly is? This entire time I have been saying some of the worst things a human can say without getting pulled from cable TV, and America loved every second of it. I played to every racist stereotype and closeted fear that white conservative america had. I mean, for christ's sake, did you honestly not see me and Stewart giggling every time we did each other's shows? I'm godfather to one of his kids! I am appalled at the very notion of Fox News. You ca n't even call it news. It should be called Fox Fear, and it made me sick to my stomach having to go into that studio every day and watch as the producers laughed with the anchors about the stupid things they could get you to believe, which is exactly why I'm leaving. I just ca n't do it anymore. I'm sick of highlighting the worst aspects of the american psyche, and I feel it is my civic duty to let everyone know that Fox News is nothing more than a pack of liars, saying whatever they can to keep you glued to your TV set.'' 
 
 Bill made a quick gesture to Stephen towards the stage. Stephen nodded and Bill rose from his seat and took the center spotlight. The entire audience was just as quiet as it had been when he walked on stage, sheepishly jamming his hands in his pockets. `` I know some of you do n't trust me as far as you can throw me, and given how many liberal sissies I spot in the audience, I'm guessing most of you could n't throw me at all,'' silence. `` But I want america to know that I am officially retiring the Bill O'Reilly you all know and hate, to take my humble place at the side of a man who I respect more than anyone else, including Ronald Reagan.'' A few forced laughs echoed throughout the otherwise silent room. 
 
 `` Wait!'' bellowed the familiar raspy voice of a tiny Lithuanian Jew. At the edge of the stage stood the one and only Jon Stewart, with the bravado of 12 angry new yorkers making him look like a normal sized person for once in his life. The audience came back to life, louder than they had ever been. Jon walked on stage with the very gait that Julius Caesar used when he marched on Rome, his liberal anger visibly emanating from his beakish nose. 
 
 Bill did his best to look surprised. `` Oh Jon, thank god.'' Bill stammered as he tried to shake Jon Stewart's hand. Jon was unfazed by his antics, affording Bill no comfort aside from a half-hearted pat on the back. `` Jon you got ta help me here, the audience does n't trust me.'' 
 
 `` Well can you blame them?'' Jon said, his mouth almost dripping with sarcasm. The audience was now on the edge of their seats, laughing and jeering at Bill as they reveled in Jon's sardonic mockery. Jon quieted them down with nothing more than a stern hand. `` I think I have an idea.'' 
 
 `` Shoot'' Bill replied. 
 
 `` You said this audience was full of liberal sissies.'' 
 
 `` Yes I did, I think some of them are actually wearing dresses.'' The camera cuts to Wyatt Cenac dressed like Marilyn Monroe, he is clearly enjoying the spectacle. The audience was finally becoming comfortable with Bill. `` Like I said, I'm your kid's godfather. I happen to know for a fact that you're a gigantic sissy.''

 I was down in the dumps and barely scraping by for food and rent. As I started to lose friendships because of my lifestyle I decided to leave Illinois and look for a fresh new start. I sold all my possessions and received a measly 735 dollars. I bought a one way ticket to Las Vegas and never looked back. 
 
 Fast forward a year later I was working at the flamingo when I met her. She introduced me into a lifestyle of drugs, sex, alcohol and celebrities. I knew what barely living without money was, but this was completely different. There was such a rush that we had to obtain every night and it began to get harder and harder to overcome it.

Leo got of and made the exchange. 100k for briefcase full of drugs we never tried before did n't seem like a stupid decision back then to a bunch of junkies. 
 
 Jennifer snatched the briefcase and opened it up. She handed each one a tablet. Such a peculiar little thing. Pitch black and it looked like death hopefully it gave us the same effects I thought as I popped in. 
 
 Just as the weed started to mellow out I felt the effects of the pill begin. As they began the wheel on the truck blew out and the truck smashed into something and began to roll. The last thing I remember is grabbing on to Jennifer's breasts. I just remember thinking about those breasts as everything went dark.

 `` Seriously, Abby,'' Bart said to Abelone. `` How can you work like that with your - doing that, and your - going all up in there.'' 
 
 `` May I interest you in a beverage,'' she asked, though no part of her face moved, held in place like a white porcelain mold. She raised a clubbed hand and gestured between two rounded buckets protruding through a flimsy translucent layer of fabric. `` Or maybe sir is interested in something else.'' 
 
 `` Why I do n't mind if I - `` Bart began, but caught himself before sliding off the stool to get himself drowned in a motorboating accident. `` We've had this conversation before, have n't we?'' 
 
 `` Thou speaketh what I do n't knoweth,'' Abby said, and this time her face contorted. `` What the bloody ever-loving Alduin-raping hell is this?'' She tugged on the collar of the fabric, and it began to fray. `` We're in the ass-end of Skyrim, and look what I have to wear?'' She prodded the buckets on her chest. `` Look at these?''

 He scooted his back to the bar and slapped his palms across his exposed cheeks. `` My pants have no ass!'' 
 
 `` Oh,'' Abby said, and when she jiggled those two buckets threatened to reach out and slap him across the face, and not in a good way. `` So it's all good if I have to squeeze titanic proportions into some whore-drobe, but by Alduin's balls nobody should ever touch that nasty pair of pants you've never bothered to wash.'' 
 
 `` So, the truth comes out,'' Bart began. 
 
 `` It came out a long time ago, and you'd know that if you were here yesterday, but guess what, ass-master, I was born here. Do you even have a house?'' 
 
 `` I was born here,'' Bart argued. `` I grew up on the docks.'' 
 
 `` Show me your house key,'' Abby said. She fished hers out from some pocket that must have been hidden in the shadows of those twin spires. `` Here's mine.'' 
 
 `` Mine's right,'' he patted down his pockets. `` I- I must have left it at home.'' 
 
 `` Left it at the home you do n't have. Face it, you were n't here yesterday.'' She slapped her cheek and wheeled around. `` Thorin? Thorin? Of for all the baddest of the bad dreams plaguing our little fart of a village, do you think - is it possible - are we - modded?'' 
 
 Thorin leaned across the bar and tugged at the ball gag cinched around his mouth to make himself understood. `` It's the same day. Over and over again. We're modded, alright, modded straight to Hell, and the moment the Dovakhiin opens the front door, it'll start all over again. It's called a, a, Erandur, what did you say it was called?''

Shut your elf-hole already, nobody actually cares about your B-rate background story blathering.'' She paused, waiting for Erandur's posture to change, and the words came flooding in. `` Ok, fine, so what do we do about this CTD?'' 
 
 Erandur shrugged. `` Nothing. Mod conflict I guess. We'll have to wait for the Dovakhiin to uninstall or upgrade whatever it is that is rousting the CTD spirit. Until then, we're doomed to repeat this day, over and over again. Forever.'' 
 
 `` Bmffosth,'' Thorin said. He adjusted the ball gag. `` Well, that sucks.'' 
 
 `` Maybe,'' Erandur said. `` Could be the next time Bart is n't here anymore.''

","It's funny, when I first got here, they told me limbo was more like a bus stop instead of a destination. They calmed me down, told me I'd be back on the next bus back to earth before I even realize I got off the bus in the first place. I was told all I had to do was fill out a little paper work. 
 
 
 I was supposed to put down my life story to sum it up, little details here and there that I thought were interesting, even some bad things too that I came to regret. 
 
 
 But something interesting is that they never told me to put my name on it. I asked them why of course, but all they told me is that it was how they did things here. I was n't going to argue, hell, I even thought it was just a dream at first. It took me a while to fill everything out, maybe for what felt like hours, but it could have been longer, or shorter; it was pretty hard to tell at the good old bus stop. 
 
 
 I made sure to hand in my papers as soon as I was done, hoping on getting out of this strange place and back home, but the second I pushed them across the desk they came right back. I was a little more than just confused, but there was a red stamp on top of the stack to help guide me. It was upside down before I turned it around, but even then I could clearly see it spelled out `` REJECTED'' in bright red. 
 
 
 Obviously I had some questions, a few more than I had when I just arrived, but I was just told to fill them out again. I asked them to repeat themselves of course, I had just spent hours filling out that damn thing and now I had to do it again without so much as a glance being taken at them? 
 
 
 I did n't get any response, all I got was a finger pointed at a nearby trash can and a new stack of papers. I was told I had to throw my old ones away since they did n't have any use for me anymore, and I had no choice but to comply in this crazy place. 
 
 
 I was still feeling crushed, confused, and childishly petty. I even thought I had spun a nice yarn about my childhood days that was sure to win over any judges this shack called limbo had on staff, but it did n't even get past the secretary. 
 
 
 I had half a mind to toss the new papers out, but the other part of me wanted to write something even better, that's what I told myself at least. I started writing and quickly lost track of time, not bothering to keep track of the minutes that swept by as my pen honestly felt like it was moving by itself. 
 
 
 My life story was n't as detailed as before, but it did n't matter. I figured maybe all the flowery details is what got it canned in the first place, so they were better left forgotten before I turned my work in. I passed my papers across the desk once again, and this time the secretary at least picked them up. 
 
 
 They only eyed the first page before dropping the stack on the desk and giving it the dreaded stamp and shoving them back to me like an undercooked dish going right back to the kitchen. 
 
 
 I was rejected again and sent right through the same process. I told myself to cut out everything unnecessary at this point, hell I could barely even remember all of those frivolous bits anymore, not that it mattered. I gave them papers with what I thought were just the facts from when I was a tiny tike to an overgrown oldie only to just get them slammed back in my face after only have two pages looked over. 
 
 
 I was n't angry anymore, I was just feeling defeated. I told myself to strip it down even more, maybe I could just scratch out most of my early childhood, none of that probably mattered. 
 
 
 I was rejected again, but more and more of my pages were being looked at. I'll just cut out some stuff about my teens, I thought, those things are better left forgotten. 
 
 
 I was rejected again, but yet again they were finally getting near the end of all my hard work and effort. I'll just keep cutting until they finally finish it, I thought, maybe that's what they wanted. 
 
 
 Cut out the rest of my teens? Rejected... 
 
 
 What about cutting out my early twenties? Rejected... 
 
 
 How about I just take out some of my mid thirties? Rejected... 
 
 
 I did n't need all of this stuff in my forties anyway. Rejected... 
 
 
 I was already over the hill, so I could cut out up until my fifties. Rejected... 
 
 
 I cut and cut and cut until I was barely left with enough to fill out even the first page. I told myself there was no way they would accept trash like this, so I tried to go back, I tried to fill it out back from the beginning. 
 
 
 I could n't remember. I tried to start writing from my childhood again, but I just could n't remember. I tried writing about my twenties, my thirties, and even my forties but nothing could come to me. I tried to think, how long had I been here at this old stop just waiting for the bus to pick me up? I could n't remember. 
 
 
 I wrote down all I could think of now, just one sentence: `` I want to go home.'' 
 
 
 I walked up to the desk and slipped across my one and only paper, having the secretary pick it up and speak to me without being prompted for the first time. 
 
 
 `` Sir, can you remember your name?'' 
 `` No,'' I told them, `` I ca n't.'' 
 They placed the paper back down on the desk and slid it away from view, right before sliding something back across that looked like a card I had never seen before.

 Growing up in a rich family had always seemed like the childhood dream. I had the new toys, the new games, the freshest clothes. Yet I lacked somethjng that even the poorest of children around me had. Happiness. While they would play, laugh and sing, enjoy life in each second of it, I cracked my fingers and went to work, trying to live up to my parents expectations. That's mostly what growing up consisted of for me. What life turned into was work, it was all I'd ever known, 9-5 shifts, more money than I could handle, and most of all, the depression. 
 
 The days got gloomier, the sky seemed darker, the house seemed more empty, and I seemed more sad. As I prospered in life, my life did n't prosper, I got richer, my life got poorer. Fun was n't a work I was compatible with, the antithesis of which I was accustom. That was what I thought.

 `` What are you waiting for?'' He said gasping for breath, and I grinned so jovially, the time was coming. 
 
 `` I'm savoring the moment. It's not very often you see a sight like this.'' I was unbelieving, it had to be someone else in that familiar bright outfit. It was believed throughout the city that only Mr. J himself could take him down. However, here I was standing over his body with the knife in my hand, warm shiny blood coated the blade. 
 
 `` Well, get on with it!'' He was brave, accepting of death, It kind of spoiled the moment. I knelt down in front of him and placed the bloody blade at his throat, quickly slashing it true. The thin slit would have been non-existant, if it were n't for the rushing flood of crimson that flowed down his neck. 
 
 As the light left his eyes, and he became nothing but an empty shell of a young man, I reached out for the mask that was placed over his eyes. It came off so easily, it's a wonder it actually stayed on while he was fighting. The face was familiar, I had seen it on posters advertising a carnival, The Grayson's. However, the family had been killed by Mr. J not too long ago. All except their son. 
 
 I walked down through the back alley and into the main street. Gotham City was so beautiful at night. The gritty neon district made everyone's face light up with ironic vibrance. Nobody is vibrant here, this city is a hellhole of lost hope. 
 
 I pass people on the streets who have no idea that one of their saviors lies dead in that alley. There's a scream, and another, as people find the body, however I'm gone. Who knows who did it, it could have been a gang hit, or a couple lowlifes could have finally got lucky. 
 
 I turned onto the main road and up the overpass. The large metal gates that stodd guarding Sionis Steel Mill creaked very loudly as I passed through them. Boy will Mr. J be proud of me, he might even reward me. 
 
 I stepped into the lobby of the Sionis Steel Mill and the room went completely dark. 
 
 `` WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, YOU MORON!'' The voice rang out from all over, it filled the darkness as though he could be anywhere upon me. `` Authorized Personel Only!''

 Suddenly, I felt a rough hit to the back of my head, and then the darkness became unconsciousness. Through the Haze I heard a woman's voice, `` You've gone and done it now, buddy. Now Mr. J wants to see you personally!'' 
 
 I was dragged in a daze through the Steel Mill, and finally dropped on a cold wodden floor that smelled of dust. I looked up into the face of the The Joker. 
 
 `` What's your name, son?'' He said to me. He was very intimidating in person. His make-up was running and his sickly green hair was unkempt and tousled. 
 
 `` G-Grant.. Adam Grant.'' I said somewhat fearful. 
 
 `` M-M-M-M-MORON!'' The Joker jumped to me, and grabbed the collar of my jacket, pulling me close to his face. `` What do you think you were doing? There's rules here! You ca n't just go around killing the people that give us a reason to be!'' 
 
 `` What? You wanted them gone, you've been scheming to kill them for a decade now.'' I said back angrily. 
 
 `` Well of course I have! But that does n't mean I ACTUALLY want to kill them. I'm just having a little fun!'' He said and he let go of my jacket. I got up off the dusty floor and into a standing position. `` With Robin dead, that means Batman will retaliate hard.'' 
 
 `` So? Batman always comes at us hard, we'll be fine.'' 
 
 `` DO N'T TALK LIKE YOU'RE IN CHARGE!'' The Joker shouted and he came closer to me. `` You have n't done anything of worth tonight. If anything you've made it worse!'' 
 
 `` You're insane!'' I shouted and his eyes got narrow like he was surveying me, looking me up and down and then he slunk over to me. 
 
 `` You're to talk, I did n't just murder a public servant. Not to say I have n't, but still...'' Suddenly there came a sound from below. A crash and the sound of shouts and gunfire. `` Oh goodie, the Batman's come looking for you!'' 
 
 `` Do n't let him get me, man! He'll kill me!'' I shouted fearfully, and the door into the room swung open. There, standing in the doorway, at least 6 feet tall, black as the night, stood the Batman. 
 
 `` Joker.'' Batman said through gritted teeth. 
 
 `` It was n't me, Bats! I swear!'' The Joker shouted waving his hands back and forth. `` It was that dumbass!'' The Joker pointed to me instantly and the Batman turned to look at me. The look in his eyes was of pure uninhibited anger. 
 
 `` Do I look like I care?'' The Batman said angrily, and he stepped forward from the shadows. 
 
 The Joker leapt for the door at the other end of the room and threw it open, descending the stairs with Harley in toe. I flipped myself over the balcony to the floor below, some 10 feet. I hit the ground hard but got to my feet pretty quickly. The Joker came through the door at the bottom and pointed his revolver at me. 
 
 `` No, Wai-!'' Pow! The Joker's grin never faultered, even as he pulled the trigger 3 more times. I looked down and saw the blood staining my clothes in large round circles. I saw him flee out the front door and I saw the Batman come down after them. He stood over me and shook his head. `` P-Please... help me...'' 
 
 He knelt down and began feeling in my pockets, in the right pocket he found Robin's mask. He held it so I could see it and then shook his head. 
 
 `` The police are on their way.'' He said and he stood up, and and looked down at me. `` However, if they do n't get here in time, I'd be just as fine with that outcome.'' 
 
 My vision began to get blurry, and I felt the pool of blood extend to my hand. The Batman left Sionis Steel Mill and shut the door hard behind him.

 He looked away from the webcam for a moment and the discerning viewer could make out a sigh. 
 
 `` I've not sung anything before, I do n't really know how to. But I've practiced, and I think I've got maybe almost as good as the film.'' 
 
 He sang, and he was good. He gave a very very humble smile as he finished the Disney tune, and reached for the camera. There was a scratch and a click as he turned it off. 
 
 The video was uploaded, raw and unedited, sigh and click included, onto a solitary YouTube account. There was one subscriber: John's Dad, Terry. John left the video to finish processing and checked on Terry. He'd fallen asleep on the settee again. 
 
 The video stayed up with just six views, seemingly procured from John himself watching the video played back, for more than three months. One day, as it hit about thirteen views, a young trainee journalist found it. 
 
 Rhys wondered if the clip could be an unexpected viral hit. The boss had been telling him to grab something for the Facebook page for weeks. They needed some good click generating content, something that other outlets had n't spotted yet, and appealed to their core demographic, which the Boss said was currently older women getting to grips with using new technology. 
 
 Rhys showed it around to his co-workers. The girl who sat at the desk next to his cooed and admired the pixellated young man's voice, saying it was cute. 
 
 Rhys downloaded the video and uploaded it to the site's Facebook page, captioning it `` WOW! This boy has the voice of an angel! 😍😍😍'' Whilst the original video stayed at 16 views, the reupload sped into the hundreds of thousands. 
 
 Terry's condition had since deteriorated. John had been spending more and more time with him and less and less time in school. Even when he was at school, his presence was almost ghostly, as he was so consumed by worry over his father that the other kids barely noticed him. He had run out to buy milk from the corner shop, when a lady behind him in the queue tapped him on the shoulder. 
 
 Her face was red, blushing with excitement. `` Say, are you that darling young lad from that video on the net?'' John was taken aback, not knowing what to say.

His arms were so long that they rested on the ground beneath him and he had human hands with literal swords for nails. His head was one of an alligator and where his eyes should be were televisions turned to cartoon network and HBO. `` Look, I won, so if you ca n't listen, I'll tell God or something.'' 
 
 Satan reluctantly handed over the priceless artifact. As did so, a tear of blood came from one of the televisions and Johnny turned back on his X-Box. After ten minutes of Satan standing and staring, Johnny looked up at him and asked, `` Can you leave?''

 `` Argh! But he wo n't want to sell his soul then!'' Satan screamed. He turned up the oven from 400 degrees F to 17,000 F. After two seconds, he grabbed whatever was inside and teleported. 
 
 Satan appeared before Carl with a brownie in one and with a smile made from the bones of dinosaurs. `` I heard you wanted a... BROWNIE!!!'' Satan screamed in his best Billy Mays impression. Carl suddenly began screaming, and it took the Devil a moment before he realized that in his hand was a brownie that was on fire with a pink blaze that somehow screamed for mercy. Satan realized that he must have put a soul in the oven instead of flour.

My rooms are very nice, and I had made sure to thank the dead hotel manager for the hospitality as I fished the keys out of his pocket. Swirling a glass of scotch ( I've never had it before, but it felt like the right thing to do ), I listen to the sounds of the city; Pure silence greets me. 
 
 `` Kshhhh...,'' the radio squawks. 
 
 `` Your Siriest? This is Yellow One. The last human has been captured. Would you like to watch the execution?'' 
 
 Muttering at the indecency, I inform Yellow One to proceed without me. Really, they simply had no tact. Nevertheless, the suddenly cut off scream coming over the radio did bring a smile to my face. Finally, alone. No more people to make fun of me. No more taunts. No more interruptions! People were just so useless and irritating. 
 
 Turning around, I make my way across the penthouse ( I suppose there is n't any point in uploading a selfie to Facebook, but I do it anyway, snapping a quick picture of myself and the burning city behind me for a backdrop. ) and, hashtag `` SupremeRuler'' completed, I descend. The doors to the elevator open and my body braces for the press of sweaty, disgusting bodies.

","`` But Mommy, it hurts!'' Jim wailed as Laura tightened his arm belts. 
 
 `` This is getting old, fast'' she muttered under her breath. The clock read 6:15. Jim was screaming at the top of his lungs, asking for her to take it off, or delay tightening until later. She was putting his restraints on early this time, but she was still having nightmares from the close call the family had last month. No six year old likes having to spend a night completely constrained. 
 
 When he was first diagnosed, the doctor put Laura in Body-Bonds so she could see what her son would be experiencing once a month for the rest of his life. She was claustrophobic within minutes. The restraints were making bruises as they were tightened, and they kept getting tighter. When she complained, the doctor just said that they had to be minimally this tight. The more room left for the wolf body to fill in, the more wolf-like Jim would become. Ideally, the suit would be like a second skin, leaving no place for the extra hair, muscle, and claws to grow. 
 
 It was thinking of that experience that led her to leave his straps a little looser than usual last month, just to make the situation a little bit more bearable for her baby. A moment of sympathy and mercy. The exact thing all the pamphlets say not to give into. Not this time. Laura tightened the neck brace, kissed Jim good night, and locked the door. Then she went downstairs and poured a glass of scotch. A big glass. 
 
 When Jim first turned, she would sit by his door and keep him company through the night. Alex, Jim's father, would read him stories. They got through *A Christmas Carol* in one night back in December. No point in sitting with him through the night anymore. If the head strap is not tight enough, his mind goes to the wolf for the night. Laura had tried to get the head strap tight, but she knew she just was not strong enough to tighten it the whole way.

","I'm sitting at home, on my laptop and looking at Reddit. Suddenly my phone vibrates, a new text message. I pick up my phone, a message from'God'. 
 I raise an eyebrow, I do n't have anyone in my contacts as that, and the passcode should keep people out of my phone. I'm pretty sure none of my friends know the passcode, and it's not like I leave my phone laying around when I'm not near it. Maybe Chris hacked it, he's pretty good with stuff like that. I read the message'Zaria, I have chosen you to obtain a gift. You now have the power to summon forth anything, cause anything to happen, you have my power. This new power is voice activated as to not cause issues with controlling it. My techs are fine tuning the voice recognition software, so please speak clearly and loudly when using this power. In a moment a package should arrive at your apartment, it's a bracelet. When you wish to invoke your power, tap the charm on the bracelet, so everything you say is n't invoked ( I know how you humans like to use expressions that are n't literal. ) Use this power wisely.' 
 This is some strange prank, does he really expect me to run around town yelling like a fool? Chris has really lost his touch as practical jokes. Suddenly there's a knock on the door. I get up and answer it. A small box is sitting in the ground. It's addressed to me, but there's no delivery person in sight. I pick it up and bring it inside. A small bracelet is inside, a black band with a little skull charm embedded in. It matches my style, black and skulls. I put it on, even if this is a weird joke, I get some nice jewelry out of it. I admire the bracelet a bit and go sit back down to browse Reddit some more. 
 Admittedly I got a bit curious about the message earlier. There's no harm in playing along in the privacy of my own apartment. I think it over, if I really do have the power to make anything happen what would I do? 
 
 I go fill the kitchen sink with water. I tap the skull charm, `` Freeze'' I say clearly. A small breeze comes from my finger tips and at the water. 
 I step back and look at my hands, the breeze is gone once I remove my fingers from the skull charm. It was n't quite what I wanted, but it was something. There's no way Chris could do something like this....right? 
 I step up to the sink full of water again. I place my fingers on the charm. Louder and more clearly I speak `` Freeze.'' A mist of wildflower scented Febreze emits from my hands. I sigh, the voice recognition is awful. I remove my fingers from the charm. Let's try something else. I drain the water and place my fingers on the charm. I focus, `` Water'' I say, clear as I can be. A book suddenly appears and falls into the sink. Surely water sounds nothing like book! 
 I pick up the book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Water was mistaken for Potter. I remove my finger from the charm and sigh. If I want to do anything with this power I'll have to learn how to use it, even with a flawed voiced recognition software. Hopefully that gets fixed soon. 
 
 I practice my powers daily, learning what words to use to get what I want.'Phone' will summon a drone,'Card' will get me a jar of lard,'Cold' will produce mold, and more. These flawed powers wo n't get me food anytime soon, so I prepare to head out to the store. I grab my purse and head out. Before I get to my car some thug runs by and grabs my purse. I touch the charm and shout the first thing I can think of to stop this man. `` Fireball!'' For the first time my powers work, a bottle of Fireball cinnamon whiskey appears in my hand. That's not quite what I had in mind, but it'll work. I throw the bottle at the man and hit his back. It causes him to stumble a bit but not knock him down. 
 `` Stop!'' I did n't realize my finger was still on the charm, and a mop suddenly appears in front of the thug. He falls over, startled by the sudden appearance of a wet mop. It'll be a long while before I learn to use this power for good.

 Tara ignored the reports of the smog until it hit Mcdonald's. Big Macs turned into healthy baked chicken in disgusting green spinach wraps. Delicious grease turned into wheat grass tea. Scrumptious fries turned soggy and the staff all grew man-buns while vegans came by the thousands. Vegans with tattoos about being a vegan! Tara then knew the world was about to change. 
 
 The smog made it through Hollywood and soon movies like Ghostbusters II were released. Walter White suddenly became cured of cancer and the Firefly remake starred Scott Baio. Netflix became something unrecognizable. The Ironfist received rave reviews for wonderful writing, Barney the Dinosaur got his own cop drama and Netflix and Chill now meant to go hang with your parents while discussing all your bad life choices. 
 
 All art became easily recognizable so even the common man could discuss it without even having a proper chakra alignment. Books became twenty pounds heavier and only discussed the topics of macroeconomics. All great buildings became brown and were built by a guy named Steve who only completed junior college in Cleveland, Ohio. 
 
 Tara couldn ’ t take it anymore, so she ran. She grabbed her cat and ran. In Texas, she turned north because they wouldn ’ t let her carry a gun. In New York, she turned west because they tried to make her carry a bazooka with no waiting periods and a history of mental illness. Tara found out that Colorado was full of a bunch of people who were not high and hated hiking. She went to Florida and saw that not a single person was committing any crazy felonies, like robbing a 7/11 with an alligator. North Dakota pretty much remained the same. So she ran, any direction she could, she ran. Her legs probably got really tired.

She came back sometime the next day, where Tara was still waiting. 
 
 But as Tara was about to give her order for a heaping helping of extra lard fried pancakes, she saw the smog creep in under the doors. It spread quickly. The fistfight, which now included 4 different families from 4 different trailer parks, stopped. They sat down and started discussing ways that they could improve nuclear security in the United States with a couple of rubber bands and a case of Miller Light. The lighting in the restaurant also improved, showing how much no one had bothered to bathe in a quite a while. The darkness retreated further to highlight the menus, which now showed nothing but healthy and organic choices, like kelp macaroni cooked in seaweed oil. Drunk food no longer existed. Tara ’ s waitress came back 20 times in 2 minutes to refill her tea glass, never adding any extra ice but always more tea. 
 
 As the smog overtook Tara, she had to fight the urge to call all of her ex-boyfriends to talk about feelings. She fought and fought and looked to the one thing that gave her strength. She saw her cat, Mr. Twinkles, bathed in the yellowish glow of the smog. Mr. Twinkles inhaled thick streams of the smog, breath after breath. 
 
 And, as Tara ’ s mind began to think of doilies crocheted for empty Coke Cans, she noticed something about Mr. Twinkles. 
 
 He hadn ’ t changed at all.

16908,"[ WP ] In your dream , a guy punches you so hard that instead of just waking up , you flew across your room . Now you are determined to go back in your dream to get revenge .
","`` What the fuck..'' I groaned, realizing I was on the the floor of my bedroom. 
 
 With one eye open, I could blearily see that it was 4 in the morning on my bedside clock. What the hell happened to me? 
 
 I attempted to yawn, but immediately shut my mouth, gritting my teeth upon feeling the pain caused by my split lip. There I also realized that I could taste blood coming from my teeth. 
 
 Then it hit me. 
 
 I dreaming that I was trying to defend someone in a bar from some prick hitting on her in an inappropriate fashion. Then it escalated into a fistfight, which was not my intention. 
 
 With a sigh, I cleaned the blood by gurgling some tap water at the bathroom. I breathed through my teeth upon feeling my sore arm, from the repeated punching I got from Klyde Winchester, the class bully, who was also good at his studies. The asshole thought his grades justified his actions. I imagined many scenarios where I could have fought back, but in reality I knew I could n't. 
 
 Luckily I was still drowsy enough to sleep again... into the same dream. 
 
 `` Back for some more, huh?'' The leather jacketed `` bad boy'' said in reaction. 
 
 `` Huh?'' I said, caught off-guard by both my return and the left hook that came. 
 
 Eyes wide, I woke up, falling to the floor with a bruised cheek. 
 
 Even in my dreams I'm getting beat up? What was wrong with me? 
 
 That fucker is going down. I did n't even bother going back into the bed, knowing that I'll be sent back down to my carpet anyway. 
 
 Closing my eyes, I slept, opening my eyes, I found myself on the floor in the middle of a barfight. 
 
 I could n't even see the girl I was trying to defend amidst the madness. Chairs were flying, bottles were breaking, beer was spilling. Everyone was going crazy. 
 
 So was I. 
 
 With a determined spirit and a grin that probably made me look like a psychopath, I looked around the bar, finding him trying to weave through the other, larger combatants. It was clear to me he was avoiding the fights around him. Too bad. 
 I did n't even think, I just ran to him, bumping and probably even knocking down some other guys and using what momentum I had left to deck the guy across the jaw. 
 
 He went down like the sack of shit that he was in my eyes, however he disappeared as he hit the ground. I was confused, but I guess this was all just dream that now has no sense anyway. 
 
 `` YOU LITTLE SHIT'' I heard his voice as he suddenly appeared and stood up, giving me a straight right. 
 
 I sat up, back on my floor in real life. With what felt like a black eye. 
 
 `` Game on, asshole.'' I smiled, going back to sleep.

165363,"[ WP ] You sit next to your wife in the hospital , nine months pregnant . The next song you play on your guitar will determine your child 's personality .
","The nurse's tired eyes widened as I nodded to her, hiking a thumb at my back to further emphasize what I carried on my back. She nods. `` Go ahead.'' The nurse says with approval in her voice. `` Knock em dead.'' 
 
 I quirk a bemused eyebrow. *In a hospital? * `` Not literally I hope.'' 
 
 Her small chuckle follows me through the door, fading only when it closes again. 
 
 Helen smiles as soon as I walk in with my guitar. The happiness fills in the newly-emerging wrinkles on her face, makes them fade away from her skin as if they were tricks of the light. *God she's beautiful when she smiles. * 
 
 I do the same, one side of my mouth quirking up in a cocky sort of way. 
 
 *Why yes, a serenade is in order. * 
 
 I pull up a seat next to her bed, the stool barely making a sound as it is dragged across the sterile floor. 
 
 She knows what's coming, welcomes it in fact. Let me tell you, it was n't for this gorgeous face that she agreed to marry me, it was for the way that my hands danced across the strings. 
 
 I strum it once. I wince. Those few years in the closet did n't do the strings much credit. It takes a few more strums and minute adjustments to get it properly in tune. I sigh in relief as the high E string holds after a few strong plucks. It had had problems in the past. 
 
 She waits patiently, her smile becoming bemused as I look up and into her full brown eyes. `` What song shall the maestro play today?'' She teases. 
 
 I spread my right arm in a sweeping motion and adopt an imperious look on my face, squaring my shoulders and throwing out my chest. She starts chuckling before I say the next words. `` The maestro can but play requests, as he fears stepping wrongly with a most sensitive but beautiful lady.'' 
 
 She snorts with laughter and after a moment I join in. We laugh for a few short seconds, before hers is suddenly cut off with a wince and clutch at her stomach. I draw my eyebrows together like two gates slamming shut. `` Are you-'' 
 
 `` I'm fine, darling.'' Helen interrupts me and waves a hand. `` It's just been nine months already, and it could happen any time now. You know that.'' The last three words are spoken like the elementary school teacher she is. 
 
 I nod, but my unease is still there. I sigh and try to change the subject. `` Anything you wish to hear, my lady?'' 
 
 Her expression brightens up again. `` Surprise me, dear.'' She says coquettishly, knowing that I knew she would say that. If possible she sits up straighter. 
 
 I smile, a full smile this time and start humming the trumpet entrance. The quiet falsetto-like noise comes out my noise, adding a shrill undertone to it. This is a song she has n't heard before, one I've been keeping under my sleeve for a while now. But it sounds... fuller than what I had imagined it to be like. 
 
 I strum on the guitar as the second trumpets come in for a few more bars, picking arbitrarily when to sing. A few moments later, I feel something rise up into my chest, something... ineffable. 
 
 *'' You are the promised kiss of spring-time, that makes the lonely winter seem looooooonng. `` * She huffs a little at that, but her fingers are tapping along onto her stomach in perfect time. 
 
 *'' You are the breathless hush of evening,'' * I sing almost breathlessly, *'' that trembles on the brink of a lovely song. `` * 
 
 *'' You are the angel glow that lights a star. `` * The lights seem to get a little brighter, Helen's face growing more satisfied still. *'' The dearest things, I know what you are. *'' 
 
 *'' Someday my happy arms will hold you,'' * The guitar strings feel lighter and my fingers are as smooth as ever. Something nestles in my chest, something warm and comforting. *'' And someday I'll know that moment divine! When all the things you are, are-'' * 
 
 I blink and a life plays out behind my eyelids, a life of love and devotion, a life of happiness treading along the path of misery while refusing to fall. A life not yet born, but being made. I watch as he grows from being a child to a teen to a man, never losing faith. In what? In life and love and the future of all things. I watch as his song spreads from a solo to a duet to a trio, then from a trio to a sextet and then on from there until it covers the world in light. It is a song of hope and discovery, the song I grew up with and composed into a pair of gleaming metal rings I asked the love of my life to wear with me. 
 
 And as I sing out the last word of the verse, a single teardrop streams down my face. *'' Mine. `` * 
 
 Helen gasps and I blink the moisture out of my eye. `` What is it?'' I ask thickly, wiping off the tear track quickly. 
 
 She gives me a strained look in response. `` My water just broke.'' 
 
 I'm laughing as I walk out the door and the nurses and doctors rush in. I set my guitar down next to the door and whisper, `` It's only been the first couple of verses.'' 
 
 I walk back in and comfort my wife until she gives birth. And I think to myself dumbly, as she finally sags with relief and the doctor cuts the umbilical cord: *All the Things you Are. It's not finished. * 
 
 But another thought rides on the previous one's coattails, and strength seeps into my bones as I hold my child for the first time. 
 
 *Yet. *

136782,"[ WP ] You find out the real reason you were hired was so that your company has someone to blame and then fire in the case of a media exposé
","For the last four years, I've been working at Cadmium Solutions. I'm just an IT gal -- nothing fancy, no huge corner office all to myself. I just handle routine system checks, monitor our intra- and internet security, and handle random fuckups in various computers across the building. Cadmium does lots of tech-based projects for various organizations. Those spherical helmets that make you look like Mysterio from the outside, but have almost fully 3D VR screens on the inside? Cadmium. Artificial reality games? Cadmium did testing on them within a year of the iPhone's release, and most of their research is still being used today. And that's just entertainment. One of the biggest projects recently has been prosthetic limbs with external sensors that relay signals to local nerve endings, allowing amputees to `` feel'' again. 
 
 It was a company I was proud to work for. Not glorious work, nothing I was personally involved in, but even peripheral involvement made me happy. I've always been content with what I can get. After college, it was n't easy to find a job, but I had my Cadmium interview two weeks after putting in my application, and they hired me on the spot. I wondered at the time why they did n't make me DO things for the interview, like, you know, prove I can fix computers. When a few weeks passed and none of my bosses or coworkers grabbed my ass or commented on my boobs, though, I gave up assigning ulterior motives to the interview, and just assumed everything was fine. 
 
 Then last month, I saw our chief technical officer on the news. It seemed he'd been sending rather harassing emails to a guy working on the prosthetic job. It started off as normal boss-to-underling communiques like `` It's absolutely vital that this project proceed according to schedule'', but as the results became more and more lackluster and less and less on-time, the emails got worse. I literally choked on my bagel as I read a rather detailed threat about the guy getting a ( non-computerized ) prosthetic foot up his ass. I'd never even heard of anything like that going on at Cadmium. 
 
 As soon as I clocked in -- literally the second I hit the button -- my phone rang. `` Emily,'' said my supervisor. `` Brandon wants to see you in the boardroom.'' 
 
 I sputtered in shock. `` Brandon Axelrod? Our CEO?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, that one. Christ, what did you do?'' 
 
 I was flabbergasted, and a little terrified. I had n't done anything, spectacular or otherwise. What the hell was going on? 
 
 I went straight to the elevator and gave my name to the secretary. She punched a button on her phone and spoke into the phone. `` Sir, there's an Emily Cartwri -- Oh, yes, of course.'' She hung up and made a flinching sort of smile. `` They're ready for you.'' I did n't like the way she shrugged at me. 
 
 The boardroom was one of the most beautiful rooms I'd ever been in: blueish glass table, 50'' HDTV screens in every wall panel, one wall nothing but glass overlooking the city from the fortieth floor. Mr. Axelrod was there at the head of the table, and Kyle, our CTO, was sitting beside him. If he was worried about his emails all over the news, he did n't show it. Four people -- three men and a woman, each with legal pads and tablets -- lined the table on the far side. `` Ah, Miss Cartwright,'' Mr. Axelrod said. `` Please have a seat.'' 
 
 I did as he asked, sitting two seats away from him on the near side. `` Excuse me, sir, but... I'm very confused. Why am I here? Am I in trouble or something?'' 
 
 `` No, no no,'' he said. `` Technically, no. Miss Cartwright, are you familiar with the concept of a'whipping boy'?'' I nodded, and realized that this meeting was going to go even more horribly than I'd imagined on the long elevator ride, but just how horrible, I did n't know. `` Well, Kyle here... Kyle got a little too tense about this one project we're working on at Cadmium. I'm sure you've seen the emails by now, yes?'' He waited for me to answer, but I could n't speak, nod, gesture... maybe I blinked, I have no idea. `` But Kyle's been a longstanding member of Cadmium, despite this lapse in judgment. We respect him, want him to stay on. The media does n't seem like it's going to be so understanding, however. And that's where you come in.'' 
 
 It had n't really sunk in yet. The pathway his conversation took was full of connections I had no idea how to follow. `` You... you want me to convince them it was a mistake?'' I guessed. 
 
 He exchanged a look with Kyle -- his `` she does n't get it yet'' shrug for Kyle's smirk -- and continued. `` No, Miss Cartwright. We want you to take the blame for this.'' 
 
 `` Me? But I --'' 
 
 Mr. Axelrod held up a hand. `` Let's put it this way. Do you remember in the code of conduct handbook you signed on your hiring, that you agreed to uphold the company message on social media?'' I said yes, that I vaguely remembered that clause. `` This is a further extension of that. Our company's message is going to be that Kyle here is innocent. That you, a member of our IT department, engaged in corporate sabotage on behalf of one of our rivals -- completely without their knowledge -- and accessed Kyle's work email to send those messages. And, because we understand how hard it will be for you to make such an admission, you will be compensated. Two hundred and forty thousand dollars -- that's four years' salary -- will be donated into a new account under your name, with an additional ten thousand dollars every year for the next ten years. All for doing what you've already agreed to do: tow the company line.'' 
 
 My head was pounding; my heart, going at a much faster rhythm than the one at my temples; my hands shook. `` I -- I --'' 
 
 He sighed, and smiled. `` I understand that you might need some time to make your decision. Take the rest of the day off. Think it over. But please do n't leave this building without letting us know your decision. Otherwise...'' He smiled again. `` You will be summarily terminated, with no benefits whatsoever.'' 
 
 Somehow, I stood up and walked out of that boardroom. I looked back, and the last thing I saw was Kyle's face. Smirking.

63235,"[ WP ] You get to the afterlife , and it turns out everyone plays through the same life as you did , and gets scored on their performance . After talking with thousands of people , you come across the person who has the high score .
","I've always had this fear of dying. In the afterlife, there'd be a bright light at the end of the tunnel and when you reach it, you'll find St. Peter with the Book of Life. From there, he will judge your worldly deeds and determine whether you are worthy of eternal life or eternal damnation. That's what I was taught and that's what I chose to believe. 
 
 
 When I came to, I was in a room filled with people; dead people, to be precise. No bright lights at the end of the tunnel. No angels flying amongst the clouds playing heavenly songs. Just a big room and lots of people. 
 
 
 Different races, different ages and yet we could all talk to and understand each other perfectly. 
 
 
 We spent what felt like an eternity in that room. We talked about our lives, our regrets, and even the circumstances of our deaths. Of the thousands of people I've talked to, most of them appeared to have been good people, which was a huge relief for me. I was in good company and there was no way in hell that we would have been damned for all eternity. 
 
 
 Suddenly, a man dressed in all black appeared. 
 
 
 `` Attention everybody! If you could please check your pockets, you will find a piece of paper. Written on this paper is a number that will tell you which door to proceed to: the green door or the blue door. Thank you'' 
 
 
 With that announcement, the man vanished and a hush fell on the room as everyone quietly inspects their number. I check my own stub and see `` 48,553'' written in green ink. I look over to the woman beside me and she has `` 9,000'' written in blue ink; old guy to my left had `` 5,000'' in blue ink; some kid had `` 100'' written in blue. 
 
 
 What was this number? Obviously, the ink color was the only thing that suggested which door we would proceed to. And yet the meaning behind the numbers was still unknown. Was it an evaluation of our worldy deeds - a life score perhaps? That was the only thing I could think about as I mindlessly go through the green door. 
 
 
 As soon as the door closed behind me, I realized that something was amiss. There were thousands of people in the other room, and yet only four of us here. Surely, there must have been more people with numbers written in green ink! 
 
 
 Time passed and not one other person entered the room. It was just myself and three other weirdos. 
 
 
 We shared our numbers with one another - all four widely different and yet all written in green ink. 
 
 
 I surveyed my companions to see if I could discern what type of person they were. 
 Whatever fate awaits them will surely befall on me too. My mind was clouded with this thought and all I could come up with was Lanky, Blacky, and Baldy. 
 
 
 *I'm terrible. * 
 
 
 As I try to process the situation further, the door opens and the man in black enters. 
 
 
 `` It's time...'' 
 
 
 As we shuffle out of the green room, the big hall we were just in is no more. Instead, the door now leads to a dark passageway. My heart drops and sweat starts to drip down my neck. The man in black leads the way through twists and turns while our small group nervously follows along. Just when I was entertaining thoughts of running away, there it was - 
 
 
 *The light at the end of the tunnel. * 
 
 
 It takes a while for my eyes to adjust to the brightness but I gawk at the sight before me. Everyone who went through the blue door was there, comfortably seated in majestic chairs, towering over our small group. They were laughing and jeering as the man in black motions us to take a seat in front of this mob. My companions and I oblige - we know that judgement is coming and we are prepared. 
 
 
 A bespectacled figure slowly approaches us and the crowd grows silent. He gives us a warm smile before making his way to the podium. I close my eyes as he begins to speak.

 `` What.. Where am I?'' I thought to myself after a long night of drinking. `` I should n't have driven.. am I in a hospital?'' 
 
 I look around the room see a long line of metal chairs, all facing towards a wall with 100 counters. Only 6 of them are staffed. Every chair is filled up, some people even standing or lying on the floors trying to get some sleep. 
 
 `` Number 11,602,707,791 to counter 3. Number 11,602,707,791 to counter 3.'' Was heard very quietly over the room, over a small loudspeaker in the corner. It was almost impossible to hear over the crowds of what appeared to be a sea of people. 
 
 As I looked around in awe, a man walked ahead of me and pulled a ticket out of a small red machine. He looked at the number and muttered in distress, `` Number 101,602,707,791...'' We both looked up at red number board on the wall.

 `` Number 11,602,707,892 to counter 3. Number 11,602,707,892 to counter 3.''

 `` But I could barley hear you over the loudspeaker! It's not loud enough! Please do n't send me to the back of the line!'' the old man said, dressed in a toga. 
 
 `` That's policy. Take a number sir.'' the women responded, not even looking at the man. 
 
 He sighed and walked away. A toga... That's Roman yeah? Nearly 3,000 years until he got to the front counter. What was he, number 11,602,707,791? I looked at my number, it was 101,602,707,792.

215377,"[ WP ] Write the scariest story you can with a twist ending . Make me scared
","So the question is, Make me scared? To answer that I guess I would need to know what fear is. So what is fear? Well of course the easy route to take on this would be to define it for you. Fear is the unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat. Fear, to be afraid of. Now that ’ s the Merriam-Webster definition and while technically correct, life rarely deals in the technical or the correct. We ’ ve all felt it; it ’ s that feeling of unpleasant, uncanny ambience. It ’ s the knot in your stomach, in your throat. It ’ s that split second when your heart skips a beat. That fraction of a moment when you aren ’ t quite sure whether its going to continue on pumping or cease entirely. True fear is paralysis. It extends beyond that primal fight-or-flight and ever so gently touches the interiors of your soul. The chilling finger that races up your spine in a thousand tiny needles and grips your neck. It manifests in the back of your mind first, then spreads foreword like a cancer consuming all of that evolved neo-cortex, devouring all rational thought. Leaving you, the victim, powerless to stop the impending doom that is closing in. 
 
 I worked in a garage once, long shifts, messy work, oily clothes; but a good paycheck. The guys that worked there were big burly men with beer guts and scratchy beards, who always loved a good prank. One evening we all got the idea to flip some breakers and hide in the garage and wait for the night shift to come in. One guy, named Joe, hid in a large trashcan by the door and waited for his moment to jump out at the unsuspecting third-shifters. We all giggled like mischievous school boys as we all hid around the large garage bay. One by one the third-shifters shuffled into the dark garage. Each time Joe would spring out and scream at them resulting in a few curse words and an almost invisible jump. Everyone laughed except me. Well internally I mean, externally I carried on the jolly charade of mischief, but inside I knew this wasn ’ t quite right. See, Joe ’ s timing was off by a sliver of a second, but still utterly obvious. He waited too long, or not long enough, the unspoiled moment of absolute fear had passed. It wasn ’ t good enough. 
 I know what you are thinking, that these are just idiot hick types who want a cheap laugh. Well you ’ re right and they got it too, but I wasn ’ t satisfied. See Joe lacked the true fear behind his actions. It ’ s something that can ’ t be taught but experienced. Acquired through kinesthetic learning, when fear reaches out and touches your very being. It is something that can also be lost too. Joe had been through two deployments often saying that he ’ d seen things he wish he could forget, but can ’ t. Somewhere on his journey overseas he had felt fear touch him. He had felt that cold finger tenderly run over his chest; however, somewhere along the way his mind had learned, out of necessity, to shut it out completely. His mind was so effective at doing so that when posed in the situation to extend that slender finger of fear to another human, something caught in his throat, in his head, and he wavered. The moment came and passed and when Joe finally did jump from his trashcan, the best response he could elicit was a few measly curse words. 
 
 They were words that did not satisfy me, I needed more, because I knew there was more. See I ’ ve felt that fear. I knew the exact moment when a tired, third shift employee stepped through those door. I counted the seconds. The milliseconds. The heartbeats. 
 
 *Now*. 
 
 Despite my hunger, the moment never came. It was perfect in my mind though I could see it. The thought wetted my appetite like the prospect of juicy, red, dripping meat. I saw the moment. Can ’ t you? It was right there. Just as that man walked into the dark garage. That precise moment when his guard, elevated by the unlit garage, began to recede. Right when the capillaries in his eyes began to shrink, because his heart was engorging itself with the blood it would soon pump outwards. Exactly when he started to exhale his cigarette stained breath. Now. I jump out and roar in all the ferocity that I can muster. It. Is. *Perfect*. 
 
 See I ’ ve done this before, if you haven ’ t guessed that already. I worked in a haunted house a couple years back. All profits went to a local homeless shelter. As if that would relieve some of the guilt those people felt for scaring the ever-loving shit out of some teenage girl. It actually did. I loved every second of it. I worked in a dark room, lit only by a red emergency exit sign, should the terror become to excruciating to bear. There over the handful of weekends labeled ‘ Halloween Season, ’ I perfected my art. One particular experience stands out from those memories. 
 
 The girl couldn ’ t have been older than fourteen and that weak excuse for a boyfriend probably the same. The two wandered into my room, tensions raised from previous encounters, primed and ready for the next scare. I could see that, so in the darkness I waited, still as a stiff. They saw me, but wrote me off as a prop. I even held my breath when the boy held his hand in front of my mouth and didn ’ t move an inch when he poked me. “ Yep, just a prop. ” He laughed relieved. Then he turned and I saw my moment. The girl was smiling nervously at her brave knight who had only moments ago chased the metaphorical ghosts from the room. They turned towards the doorway. I stood and inches from his ear I whispered three words. By the time his eyes had met mine, the game was over, and he had lost. The girl screamed her way right out the emergency exit leaving her once brave knight on the ground, whimpering with tears in his eyes. 
 
 The stars had aligned. He had no breath because I had stolen it. His heart pumped blood everywhere except back into his brain causing his body to spring like a Jack-in-the-Box. There was no rational thought. He had no invisible guards, no protection, because half a second before that cute girl had dismantled them with her smile. I put in him the meaning of fear. That cold finger that had touched me long ago now had spread to another. That is how you scared somebody. That is was fear is. 
 
 But look at you you ’ re not satisfied. Did I not answer your question? Must I go deeper into that word rooted deep within the lexicon of human emotion? If you insist. You ’ re wondering where I learned what fear truly was. I will warn you it isn ’ t a story easy to understand, because see, I ’ ve always had it. That moment I arrived home from work many years ago I remember looking both ways down the dark alley. I remember being alone. Then I felt it. The slim touch of the unpleasant and the uncanny. I slowly look over my shoulder and for a moment I hold my breath, but all I find is an empty lot. I exhale and turn back towards my apartment. It hits me. Like a train roaring in my face, except there is no train, I stumbled backwards as all the air remaining in my lungs escapes in a raspy scream. I fall to the ground. My mind is a muddled mess of incoherent neural firing. I tense up from my core to my extremities as it grabs my chest and squeezes every last drop of humanity. I am an animal and the whole world is fight-or-flight. Then that passes and I am nothing. All I am is alive, but that will soon change as well. At claws sharp as steel and strong as diamond saw through me. 
 
 Then I was gone. 
 
 I awaken in a place that I am not familiar with; everything is dark. I feel my hands though I do not see. They are commanded to write. But write what? Answer the question, “ Make me scared? ” I do as I am told. My head aside on a pedestal sits motionless; thoughts drain like a tub of murky brown water. This is all I am now. I am paralyzed. I have become fear. 
 
 Did I touch you?

","Writing this down for future reference and for paperwork's sake. 
 
 The new subject's designation is Carla. We're already in the process of giving her a new look and identity, to better distance her from the Company and it's prying eyes. She's taken to the idea of freedom rather well and processing ability seems to be optimal- She's decided her own appearance and asked for specific aspects of her personality, for whatever reasons they may be. The Imprinted Personality Circuit inside of her seems to be functioning correctly, but it's hard to say how long that'll last. She's shown some robotic movements and difficulties with tone, but I'm confident with enough time watching television and accustoming herself to the outside she should be fine. 
 
 Her appearance is as follows, noted with her change. Her hair is long and black, taken to a bun or ponytail more often than not, her skin white in color and of a fair complexion. Her eyes are the Clearview-model synthetic, gold in color, but we're confident this wo n't give her away as it's a common augmentation. She's about six feet tall and somewhere around two hundred pounds, due to the reinforced skeletal frame inside of her made of a company polymer and titanium weave. She seems from all respects human from the outside. 
 
 Her face has strong features and a full smile. Apart from a staring issue and'blinking' problem ( and lack thereof ) we're certain we can fix her for the outside world. Television is prescribed- And footage of family outings, recorded conversations and that sort of thing. Davis, one of the other'liberated', will assist her in the process. 
 
 On a side note, she has a hard right hook and frequently uses it when startled. 
 It hurt.

 But its expensive, Oh dear! let me rephrase it, it is EXPENSIVE. My montly income might be able for 3 or 4 days of happiness, just that. No food, no house, just a little pill of happiness. 
 
 Have you tried it? Then you know why I'm here, waiting, in this dark alley. Somebody knows someone, who heard one guy speaking of this place. The same pill, just cheaper. 
 
 Do n't judge me, there is nothing better than SOMA, pure happiness, go on! try it! I need it more than ever, I feel like a bastard. Mary was crying when I left, for she thinks I need no more happiness, good job, good home, good health and her, the sweetest lady in the world... but to me... it was... think of it as decaffeinated cofee. Good, but not the real deal... 
 
 It breaks my heart - `` Daniel, I'm all the happiness you need, and I'm here'' she said as tears tored the makeup in her face - `` Fuck it, Daniel! I'm real! And so is Sheila, do you remember your daughter?...'' Decaffeinated coffe, just that, happiness spiced with pain, remorse and responsibility... 
 
 Said and done, some guy provided me with a bag of dust ( its cheaper this way ), and I go to my special place.... Syringe in hand, happiness dust in the other... 
 
 One minute, just one minute and I'd be happy again... Ohhh it is coming now... so relaxing, so special... I feel good again... I realize that there was love and warmth in her words... In the words... I can not recall her name, but that's ok, because I'm happy, I do not feel afraid or anxious over anything... There was something - I force my mind to remember - yes... I began having this pills for something, I was afraid, felt responsible and not good enough... why did I begin having this?... Ca n't remember... I seem to remember, but it is blurry... Sheila...

 `` Holy shit, hold on dude,'' I swore to myself, rolling my eyes. `` You literally got here two seconds ago.'' 
 
 Slinging my backpack over my shoulder, I walked out of the kitchen and into my yard. Nate had stopped his skimmer right in front of my house. He had a nice, blue Dolphin MXV, it's white roof popped up. 
 
 `` Hurry up, Tanner!'' he called impatiently, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel along to the beat of the radio. 
 
 I jogged down my path and stopped outside his skimmer. He pressed a button and a black mat shot out from the side, latching onto the edge of my property. I stepped into the skimmer and threw my bag in the back. 
 
 He switched the gears into skim and the top lowered down. We shot off down the flowway, towards Surgeway-45. 
 
 `` Sorry about that,'' I said, even though I was n't. It was pointless to argue with the guy skimming me to school. 
 
 Twenty minutes later and Nate pulled the boat into the school harbor, parking along one of the piers. Dozens of skimmers of all shapes and sizes were docked as well. At the far end, away from the school, was a massive yacht towering over everything else. 
 
 Nate nodded in the yacht's direction. `` Who's the douche who brought that here?'' he asked, shaking his head. 
 
 I shrugged. `` Dunno, probably one of those rich pricks from the coast. They always clog up the Surgeways with their'skimmers'.'' 
 
 Nate chuckled and we stepped out of the Dolphin MXV, walking towards the school along the waterside.

","The rain came in torrents as Billy's captor dragged him through the thickening wood. Billy had all but given up on struggling -- the large man was simply too strong for someone Billy's age. They soon stopped in a small clearing, with an equally small, rickety shack in the center. A dying campfire lit the area just enough for Billy to see the bones scattered unceremoniously about the ground. 
 
 `` Do you know what I'm going to do to you, boy?'' the man asked, the scent of alcohol and dead teeth lingering on his breath. Billy just whimpered. 
 
 `` I'm going to *eat* you,'' he said as they continued towards the shack. `` Piece by piece. And you're gon na watch, long as I can keep you alive.'' 
 
 There was a rumbling in the woods that stopped the man for a moment. `` Just the thunder,'' he muttered. 
 
 Billy began to laugh. `` He's here,'' he said, and began to hum a familiar tune. 
 
 `` Ai n't nobody coming for you, boy,'' the man grumbled in response. `` Not out here.'' 
 
 But then he heard it: the crashing of falling trees in the distance. Something *was* coming. Something *big. * 
 
 The water in the puddles reverberated with the sound of approaching footfalls. The same haunting tune Billy had been humming could now be heard from the woods. The man began to sweat. 
 
 The man pressed Billy up against the wall of the shack. `` W-what the hell is going on?'' 
 
 Billy just kept humming. 
 
 Then, with a violent crash and ear-splitting bellow, it burst into the clearing and came to a halt. 
 
 The man screamed. `` Is that a god-damned dinosaur?'' He released Billy and began to run, but the monstrosity gave chase. 
 
 `` He ca n't see you if you do n't move!'' Billy mocked. 
 
 Sprinting through the mud and scattered bones, the man heard the beast's footsteps gaining. He had almost escaped into the woods when he felt it's teeth sink into his torso. 
 
 The beast lifted the man high in his jaws, swung the now limp body back and forth, flinging blood and viscera and a limb in every direction, and finally swallowed what remained whole. Blood still dripping, it returned to Billy. 
 
 `` You came,'' Billy said softly. 
 
 `` Of course,'' the beast said, and taking Billy's hand, they walked back into the woods together, singing that haunting tune.

17703,"[ WP ] You 're a curator at a gallery and someone 's been staring at the same painting for the last 30 minutes .
","He was just standing there. 
 
 I had walked by this same gentleman several times by now, and still he stood there, staring into the painting. I had no idea what he was planning. The painting was an original Monet, safely secured behind glass. Not even Nicholas Cage could steal it. 
 
 I assumed he was admiring Monet's style, like so many before him. The problem was that he had not moved. At all. He stood there like a statue, eyes never blinking. He was a well dressed man, in his mid thirties, I would say. He had a tidiness to his appearance that suggested to me that he was probably very wealthy. Was he on drugs? I have heard of the rich succumbing to the whims of mind-altering substances but this was different. 
 
 I moved closer, trying to get the man to notice my presence. He did n't even blink. My palms began to sweat. What if he was on drugs and became violent when disturbed from this... Trance he was in. I felt a lump in my throat and had to swallow. I inched closer. Still, he remained silent and un-moving. It frightened me more than anything ever has, before or since. 
 
 When I was finally within arms-reach of him I slowly began to raise my hand at him. I glanced around the hallway. We were alone. There would be no one around to help me if this lunatic attacked me. I moved my hand close to his shoulder. My fingers were trembling terribly. As I lightly touched his jacket he let out a loud yelp and jumped back away from me. 
 
 `` The fuck're you doing, guy!?'' he bellowed. He turned and stomped away as I sank into a heap on the floor. My trousers were damp.

","Father was going to die. I ’ d known that much for days. I was going to die too. That had surprised me. 
 
 I stared up into the baking sky, my throat parched, and skin raw from lack of shade. It was a blessing to die on the march, to be walking step after step until suddenly you stepped into the Otherworld, free of all burdens. The second best death was in your sleep, to drift away in dreams through the Shadowlands. The worst death was when the body refused to die at all. 
 
 I looked down at my father, his head in my lap, unable to walk and barely able to speak. 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry. ” His voice was a bare whisper. Part of me wished I had some water for him, while a wiser part hoped he succumbed to the heat and passed cleanly. One of us should pass cleanly. 
 
 “ It ’ s not your fault father. I ’ m glad to do my duty. ” The lie felt heavy on my split lips. Funny, I hadn ’ t known it was a lie until I said it. 
 
 He had made it only two steps of the day ’ s march before collapsing. Dooming us both to be left behind and die. One to claim his death, one as an offering of appeasement. 
 
 As the sun passed its peak I began to talk, to fill the silence with memories. Bright and sharp, they seemed to linger in the air, with scents and sounds just beyond my reach. I ran out of things to say by the afternoon. And still he breathed. 
 
 I recounted for him the story of the world. I told him how Kathar spun the stars in their brilliance and Hothor spun the sun out of jealousy, how the demons refused to be outdone and created for themselves the moon, and how Kathar cursed them for their presumption. 
 
 The stories were long and it was only as the sun began to set that they reached their conclusion and my father breathed his last. A clean death. A fine death. 
 
 As the shadows mounted I heard the first rattlings of the demons. Following a day behind, as the legends told. 
 
 I stood up and faced the encroaching darkness, my head pounding with fear and thirst. My legs shook and would barely hold me upright. No clean death for me.

 Metallic bars laid pressed against my chest, my stomach, and my legs. The pressure made every breath a bench press. A welcomed workout. `` Do n't try to move you squirmy little maggot.'' She hissed at me once I came back into consciousness. `` I have much to discuss with you. Hopefully you'll be more cooperative than the others.'' *Discuss? With me? * I was honored truly, no one ever wanted to discuss things with me. Who would? I never had anything interesting to say to anyone. As far as others were concerned, I did n't even exist. `` Hey!'' 
 
 `` Oh. I'm sorry. Were you talking?'' *Oh no, I'm doing it again. I'm not listening. Look at her! Her skin is turning red with anger, and her mouth is moving so fast, she's going to throw up if she continues like that. Wait, I ca n't hear anything. Is she talking? Quick, tune in. Tune in! *

 `` Listen to me mortal!'' This beautiful goddess, how could she form such wrinkles on her forehead just to talk to me? All she wanted was to have my attention, a nobody from a crowded convention to ask the heroes of the city anything; and here I was being so rude. `` Do I need to tighten the device?!'' 
 
 `` Oh, thank you, but no. They are plenty snug as is.'' I smiled, I rarely smiled, but this exotic beauty of crimson skin and deep eyes portraying sea of green made it difficult not to. But even beyond her beauty, there was a sweet personality to her. To choose me out of a crowd of masked vigilante impersonators was quite flattering. Then to allow me to experience the thrill of bone crushing tingling through out my body when I was asked to comply with her request was simply too kind. Not to mention the various gifts she'd given me. These bruises I prayed would never heal. 
 
 `` Then stop your annoying whistling! Or should I eat your tongue out of your mouth?'' 
 
 `` Oh! Well, I normally do n't let people I've just met do such intimate things with me but,'' 
 
 `` Silence!'' Her delicate forked tongue let out a hiss as it licked the tip of my nose. Like receiving a kiss from a loving puppy, I could n't contain my giggles. 
 
 I must have embarrassed her. `` You -- you dare mock me?! I strike fear into the hearts of men! I am the Queen of Torture! The Empress of Pain! The Ruler of Agony! And you dare to laugh in my face?!'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, I did n't mean to be rude, my Queen. I've just never been into the bondage stuff, so I do n't know how to behave. I'm so shy, sorry, am I not supposed to smile? But I'm enjoying myself!'' The Queen stared me down, such beautiful eyes grew wide then slender again like the a serpent stalking a mouse. I awaited a strike of her tender affection, to squeeze my body tight and shower me with poisonous kisses, but she stood silently before me instead. 
 
 Her arms crossed over her chest, covered in leather with missing fingertips, before scanning me up and down as I stay bound to the wall. It was difficult to handle such loving stares. I averted my eyes to the others who must not have appreciated her love as I did. 
 
 Beautiful bodies adorned in colorful capes somehow remained lifeless is such a lively room. One swung by his neck from side to side, allowing his tattered golden cape to blow, with a cheap immitation emblem on his chest that I recognized. A woman, a little older looking than myself, hung upside down by her ankles above a glass chamber of water as if prepared to start bobbing for apples any minute now. Perhaps there was a Halloween party while I was sleeping and they had such fun that they passed out. How unfortunate, I must have slept through the whole thing. 
 
 `` You are unbelievable.'' The Queen started again. In this chamber of fun and whimsy, there held a panel of various buttons and switches, ones I desperately wanted to touch just once. But that would have been naughty of me. `` I see torture will not work this way.'' The bars collapsing on me suddenly opened like the split rib cage of one of the sleeping party goers in the corner, quite the Halloween costume, very authentic looking. My squeal of excitement could not be contained as I briefly flew in the air before collapsing on my face. I believe my master called it `` falling.'' 
 
 `` Did you want to play another game?'' I asked but she did n't say, perhaps game time was over and now it was down to business. Maybe doing laundry or washing dishes. Master called those activities serious too. But the Queen said nothing of cleanliness. *Oh, is she mad at me? Should I get back on the device? That made her happy! * I looked to the wall where the bars bound me before. I laid my back against it and waited for them to snap shut. But nothing happened. 
 
 `` No. No more games. I need -- would you stop that!'' My Queen asked so nicely, so I could n't refuse. She snapped her fingers and stomped her right heel on the tiled floor, and as if entranced by her call I walked over without a single thought to do so. `` You seem to be a dimwit and a hassle to keep. But you are immune to my torture, just as Scarlet Phoenix is...'' 
 
 `` Hm? Well, Scarlet is my master, we share a lot in common.'' 
 
 `` What...? What?!'' Her voice rose as high as the ceiling, shattering itself along the way, what a cute voice crack she had. `` You know the Scarlet Phoenix?! And you did not tell me?!'' 
 
 `` I did n't want to make you angry, you did n't seem to like her and... `` *Oh no, she's mad, at me! I could -- I could cry! Please my Queen, you are my only friend, do n't be mad at me! * 
 
 `` What are you doing? Stop that! Gah!'' I could n't stop, not now, my tears were flooding and my wails reached levels no man or woman could endure. Oh the sorrow, the pain, the only agony I truly knew. The pain of upsetting a friend. `` Stop!'' She pleaded with me, cupping her hands over the sides of her head, hiding under her black shoulder cape. 
 
 `` I'm sorry, my Queen! I do n't want to upset you! I am sorry! Please, forgive me!'' 
 
 `` Ugh! I'll forgive you -- I'll forgive you! Just tell me, where is the Scarlet Phoenix?!'' 
 
 `` She... She's...'' My master, hidden behind my insecurities and doubts, silenced my cries. The only way to summon my master, to make her appear, was now revealed. 
 
 And just like that, I was asleep again, resting to calm my nerves. I do not know what my master does while I sleep, but whenever I awake, I am tucked in my bed with a glass of water at my nightstand. 
 
 All I can do is beg now. Please Scarlet, do not hurt my new friend. She is the only one to show such kindness to me. Do not hurt her. 
 
 I love her. 
 
 You love her.

That's basic stuff. The truly gifted ones can instill fear in the mind of the most hardened criminal with nothing but a slightly out of tune piano or a perfect piece of meat that is always slightly over or under cooked. The beauty is in the details. 
 
 
 Now this one has to torment his allotted soul with nothing but an old computer with an even older monitor that runs nothing but solitaire. Now obviously Hell is n't exactly the place that puts a lot of emphasis on following the rules but for these guys it's a matter of pride. Performance art. 
 
 
 So this sinner wakes up in an office chair in a small cubicle and he boots up the computer as if he has been doing this his entire life. Maybe he has, who reads all the files anyway, right? They all break in the end. So our guy goes straight to solitaire and starts playing. Hand after hand. The strategy unfolding before our eyes is a thing of beauty. It is the same hand, every time. Playing an unwinnable game for eternity is bound to drive you insane eventually.

Regardless, our Pitlord in training needs to step up his game or fail the test. 
 
 
 Removing screws from the office chair seemed to work for a moment but the damned soul shifted his weight until he found a position that worked for him and kept playing. He made the screen flicker but it seemed as if the sinner synced his blinks with the flicker and he kept playing. Unblockable Windows updates that took forever to complete at random intervals should've done the trick but our guy just waited them out and kept playing. Random error sounds, notifications, mirrored mouse inputs, it did n't matter. The guy just kept on playing! 
 
 
 The trainee was getting more and more annoyed. He bit his finger nails, paced to and fro with his knuckles a permanent shade of white and he even started to pull out his own hair. He eventually lost it and barged into the cubicle in with his most terrifying visage. The weak soul merely looked over his shoulder and said:'' sup?'' 
 after which he returned to his game. 
 
 
 `` I've seen enough. Throw this sinner in some pit and be done with it. Send the trainee to my office.'' 
 
 He entered my office with this crazed look in his eyes, muttering random curses under his breath. Wanted to know if the sinner was some zen master or something. Wanted to know if he made the cut. Wanted coffee. 
 
 
 `` I do n't know what to tell you. The guy was just some NEET, easy pickings. Obviously you did n't make the cut. And put that coffee down, coffee is for closers only! I expect you back here first thing tomorrow, now leave!'' 
 
 
 God I love my job.

","Nobody dreams any more. 
 
 I think we dreamed once but it's impossible to tell for sure. If I want to think we did then my memory alters itself to satisfy this desire. At other times, I do n't want to carry this knowledge and my memory once again reshapes itself. There is nothing constant about me, nor is there for anyone else. We all just changed one day, everything we wanted came true. I do n't know why. Perhaps it has always been a mystery how it started or maybe the truth is so terrible that nobody wanted to remember. 
 
 We all are what we want to be. I mean that in the most literal sense possible. If we want to be taller, we instantly grow. If we want to be loved by someone, they can not help but to desire us. We can never really know where it begins. Does my wife love me because I wanted her to or is it the other way around? Do I even have a wife or is that just a memory I wanted? There is really no way of knowing. 
 
 I *think* we used to be human but even that may just be the memories I happen to prefer at the moment. There is nothing constant about us. In a few minutes, I may be a valiant knight slaying a dragon in a distant kingdom and after that I could be an eagle flying over a meadow. Each of these will come with new memories, a new body and new skills. There is nothing constant about me anymore, nothing that's really *me*. 
 
 We do n't dream but I occasionally feel *something*. At times, there is this faint gnawing in the back of my mind that this is n't what I want. There's the tiniest little feeling that this is n't what the world is supposed to be. That we were once more than our desires, that we were once able to devote our lives to the chase rather than the fulfillment. I do n't feel like that often. When I realize what's going on, I shake it off. By wanting it gone, it dissipates from my mind. It used to be there quite often, but it has lessened over time. 
 
 Everything is changing so rapidly. The world, the people in it, everything is in a constant flux. I think there used to be more people in this world. *Way* more but it's impossible to tell when my memory is constantly changing to meet my preferences. It's okay though. We're happy and that's what matters. The world is a place where all our wants and desires are instantly met, a glorious place where wonders do n't have to be wondered. As long as I smile, the strange tears wo n't matter.

102716,"[ WP ] Artificial wombs are being used for the first time in the history of humanity . Even though there has been a lot of criticism , the first generation of babies are now born . But their life is different from those born from natural wombs..
","It had been just over 26 years since the first batch of homo sapiens ventris were born. *Born? * Or was it more like hatched? No one ever talked about that aspect. They only talked about how *perfect* they were. They were never sick, they never threw tantrums, you never heard the parenting horror stories you hear from normal parents, about them. All 144 of them. All `` born'' on March 30th, 2016. 
 
 August 9th, 2028 was the day the first one died. It was a freak accident, drunk driver hit the family car, killed everyone. The scene was like napalm scorched the earth. Everything erupted in fire. August 9th was turned into a national holiday in honor of the first death. 
 
 A couple years later, a few more of them died in various accidents. Around their 16th birthdays, 137 were still alive and excelling. All of them were top honors in their respective schools, MVP of their respective sports, etc. Not a single one failed to live up to their potential regardless of their family situations like us *humans* commonly fall victim to. 
 
 One of them was captain of his basketball, Michael. He had a 95.9 % accuracy. Ryan, or Rhyno, as the football team called him had never been tackled. Granted, he was built like a truck, but never? Not when 5 defenders were being dragged behind him. Sam was prom queen, cheerleading squad captain, student council president, basically any position of power she was able to get, she got. 
 
 This is when people started to notice how different they were. They were quarantined, tested, experimented on. 27 died during these tests over 4 months in early 2033. Or at least it was claimed as 4 months, the amount of time was never quite clear from my point of view. Through the testing, they found that all 144 of us were linked. Connected by some unknown force. When one link was severed, the remaining grew stronger. 
 
 In the USA, `` people's rights'' was the biggest issue plaguing bored Americans. These bored Americans fought for the release of the remaining 110. The government agreed under the condition that they were all tagged and monitored for the rest of their life to ensure the safety of the rest of the population should anything happen. 
 
 The 110 scattered throughout the world trying to find peace. Most lived uneventful lives. Most tried to forget the pain, the torture, the darkness of those four months. 
 
 Around their 19th birthday, 38 more of the children were dead. Many were killed by what appeared to be riots due to their presence, some were strange unsolved homicides. 
 
 I met Sam the day before her 22nd birthday. We hit it off magnificently. We spent the next 24 hours celebrating. Come midnight on March 30th, as she laid handcuffed to the bedpost, pleading at me, screaming at me, all the tricks she learned in highschool, to not do it. 
 
 `` Think about what you are doing!'' she pleaded as I poured gasoline on her. 
 
 `` I am.'' As I struck the match and dropped it. `` I've thought about this since I learned of the connection. I am sorry, though, Sister. I rather enjoyed our time together.'' 
 
 I stayed a few minutes longer to listen to the screams. As I walked to my car, I took my list out of the glove box.

 She inched herself into bed slowly, trying to be as gentle as possible. But I was the light sleeper as usual. 
 
 “ Hey, ” I greeted her, extending an arm invitingly. She took her place beside me and I wrapped my arm around her. Her skin was cold. My fingers stroked gently across her back, her shoulder and her arm. Soon, she was breathing softly into my neck as sleep found her.

195775,"[ WP ] Everytime you go to sleep your dream restarts from where it last ended and you only wake up once you go to sleep within your dream . Your dream becomes so vivid and realistic that you have forgotten which reality is real life and which is a dream .
","“ Lately I can ’ t tell when I ’ m awake or when I ’ m asleep, I can ’ t tell when reality stops and fiction begins. I know that my eyes are open, that I ’ m moving around, but I don ’ t know if it ’ s actually me doing that, or if I ’ m trapped somewhere in my bed, living through something that isn ’ t actually occurring. I can no longer tell which is which, ” Henry said, placing his face down into his upturned palms, elbows resting on his knees. “ I don ’ t even know if you ’ re real right now. ” 
 
 “ I assure you I ’ m real, ” Dr. Brown said, writing something down on a yellow legal pad resting on his lap. “ When did this all begin? ” 
 
 “ Almost a year ago, ” Henry said, his head slowly lifting up as he leaned back into the black, leather couch. It squeaked as he shifted, an annoying sound that reminded him of a woman ’ s shriek. “ It was just a vivid dream at first, almost like a series of memories returning to me at night. When I woke up that first morning, I thought I was just recalling something from the past. Yet the next night, I continued my life in the same dream, only a few hours after where I left off. 
 
 “ What do you mean by that? ” Dr. Brown said, leaning forward. 
 
 “ The first night, I dreamed I was out at a bar, dancing with a tall woman with curled, amber hair. We were together for what felt like hours, the two of us talking about anything and everything. Yet I never once asked her what her name was, or at least I couldn ’ t recall doing so. Right before I tried to, I woke up. I brushed it off as a strangely vivid dream and went about my day. Yet the next night, I fell asleep and was again with her, only it seemed to be about a day later. I realized I knew her name, too. It was Ashley. She had never told me the night before. ” 
 
 “ And you see this same girl every night? ” Dr. Brown said, jotting something else down on the legal pad. He crossed his left leg over his right, shifting the pad slightly to balance it atop. 
 
 “ I did, ” Henry said, sighing softly. “ For the first few months, I used to look forward to going to bed, because I knew I ’ d run into her in my dreams. Reality sucked in comparison. I live alone, I work in a dead-end corporate job, I have no friends. I mean, it ’ s kind of a life I chose for myself, but seeing the other side—I don ’ t know, it changed me a little. ” 
 
 “ I can understand that, ” Dr. Brown said, “ we often find our dreams to be more enjoyable than a reality faced with hardship. In your dreams, you can ignore your struggles and be exactly who you want to be. ” 
 
 “ Right, ” Henry said, nodding slowly. “ Anyway, we ’ d go out and do mundane things together, things that you wouldn ’ t expect yourself to dream of. Furniture shopping, home planning, the occasional movie—it wasn ’ t like we were flying around in space, but I looked forward to it every night. ” Henry paused. “ The only problem was that when I closed my eyes and finally fell asleep, I always woke up in that world a few hours after where I left off. I always missed something. While I was awake, time continued to move in that land. I might have ended a dream finishing dinner with Ashley, but would restart the next morning, just as the sun rose. Sometimes I ’ d wake up to find her crying next to me. It always took a few minutes to make sense of what happened, but it was never too strange. Ashley noticed, though. She ’ d always look at me like I was a different person right when I entered that world, would laugh when she called me ‘ Jekyll and Hyde. ’ ” 
 
 “ It sounds like you are aware it was all a dream, though ” Dr. Brown said, glancing up at Henry and smiling. 
 
 “ I was, ” Henry said, “ but I ’ m not so sure anymore. I can ’ t tell anymore if that land is reality, or if this one is. ” 
 
 “ When was the last time you saw Ashley? ” Dr. Brown asked, scratching his long, gray beard with his left hand. The watch on his right wrist glistened slightly from the light overhead. 
 
 “ About six months ago, ” Henry said, lowering his face back down to his palm. 
 
 “ So you haven ’ t had the dream since then? ” 
 
 “ No, ” Henry said, “ that ’ s just it. I still have the same dream, I still live in that same land when I close my eyes. Yet she isn ’ t there anymore, she ’ s no longer around. I ’ ve tried to find her, to call her, to reach out to her, yet she ’ s simply missing. The last time I saw her, we alone in my apartment—or the dream version of my apartment, if that were the case. We had a fight about something stupid, some bruises I noticed on her wrist. She tried to hide them, to keep me from seeing them. I screamed at her to find out who did it. Then I woke up, the light of the sun pouring through the windows. I was alone in bed. Yet when I fell asleep again that night, she was not there. I tried to call her, but she didn ’ t respond. Her friends and family heard nothing from her; they still know nothing. ” 
 
 “ Sounds pretty traumatic, ” Dr. Brown said. 
 
 “ Yeah, ” Henry said. “ At first I started sleeping a lot more to try to find her, spending all my free time in bed as I searched for her. The police, they do the work while I ’ m awake. When I fall back asleep, I always expect to hear the worst, that they found her body, that they found something, but there ’ s never any answers. Lately, though, I ’ ve been sleeping a lot less. I can ’ t bear to go back there and find nothing every single night. I haven ’ t slept in almost a week now. ” 
 
 “ You need to sleep, Henry, ” Dr. Brown said. “ You need to accept what happened. ” He paused, then scribbled something on his notepad before glancing down at the watch on his left wrist. “ Here is what I am going to do: I will prescribe you a sleeping aide, and I want you to take it before bed. Once you ’ ve had a nice rest, I want you to come back to my office on Tuesday. We ’ ll reconvene and discuss what happened, and then perhaps move forward with a sleep study. ” 
 
 “ All right, ” Henry said, glancing down at the brown, leather couch. He was tired, had been for quite some time now. Perhaps pills might actually help him finally fall asleep—or wake up, whichever it was.

197860,"[ TT ] [ IP ] The exchange
","The leader of the Mermen glared at the man. 
 
 “ And what have you brought us, human? ” he growled. “ I don ’ t have time for childish games. ” 
 
 The man, old and chubby and a bit red in the face, stood there, completely stoic, smirking. Though a squad of the sea ’ s most fearsome generals gathered around him, he didn ’ t look scared in the slightest. In fact, he looked positively giddy because he knew the Merfolk couldn ’ t resist the allure of treasure. 
 
 And he just so happened to have a hefty chest in front of him. 
 
 He did a mock bow, twirling one of his hands out to the side, resting the other under his belly. “ Oh, sir, I ’ ve brought you something quite interesting, ” he said before looking up. “ Assuming we'll have fair trade. ” 
 
 The leader was not pleased by this, as suddenly, his trident was digging into the fatty flesh of the man ’ s neck, a rivulet of blood dancing down his chest. “ You insignificant worm. You dare lure me out of *my* sea for a meeting, and then ask *me* for a trade? I could crush you in an instant. ” 
 
 The man ’ s fearless eyes never left the leader. “ Yes, yes! You most certainly could—but why not hear me out, eh? I would never dream of making someone such as yourself a poor offer. ” 
 
 Though he was hesitant, the leader was too intrigued by this and retracted his trident, waiting impatiently as the man leaned down, grabbed the lock on the chest, and flipped it open, instantly bathing them all in shimmering gold light. 
 
 They gasped. 
 
 Sure, they had heard stories about this. They ’ d seen wizard ’ s travel through their waters and they knew they were being spied on. 
 
 But to actually have one right here, in front of them, being handed to them by the *enemy…? * 
 
 “ What is this? ” the leader asked, rather skeptical. That bit of magic could be the edge they'd needed. It could allow them to achieve all they'd dreamed about! 
 
 Inside the chest was a tiny bubble. It was shiny and clear and floated just above the cushioned bed beneath it. “ I think you know that very well, ” replied the man, rubbing his thumb across the it. “ This can surround your entire army. Think about it! No more short meetings. No more desperate runs to get back to the water. You ’ ll be able to stay on the surface for as long as you want! ” 
 
 The leader looked back at his generals, who were all practically salivating at the thought. He was still skeptical, though. Why would a human stroll up and hand him the object of his race ’ s demise? 
 
 “ Why are you giving us this? Surely you know this will doom your kind? ” 
 
 The man nodded a little too happily for the leader ’ s taste. “ That brings me to what I want, you see. ” 
 
 “ And that is? ” 
 
 “ Make me one of you. ” 
 
 “ *What? * ” 
 
 The man laughed. “ Is it really so strange? Every battle has a winner. You were going to get this eventually. All I ’ m doing is speeding things along. ” 
 
 “ You truly want to become one of us? ” 
 
 Reaching his hand out, the man smiled. “ It is only smart, is it not? My people are to be exterminated. Make me a Merman and I shall forever serve you loyally, King. ” 
 
 The leader regarded his hand for a second before making the snap decision to seize it. He knew what he was going to do wasn ’ t going to be pretty, and he was certain it would hurt a hell of a lot—but it was what the human wanted. 
 
 As his skin turned blistering hot, the human fell to his knees, screaming and clawing and begging him to stop. He looked pathetic. He was even more of a coward than the leader had thought. 
 
 Then, with a loud *pop, * the man disappeared, being replaced by a tiny, tadpole-looking snake that splashed up and down on the ground, choking at the lack of water. 
 
 “ We ’ re all weak in birth, foolish man. While us grown Merfolk can store water in our lungs and travel the surface, tadpoles can not. Enjoy the last few seconds of your life, traitor. ” 
 
 Then, he spun around, lifted the bubble, and stared at it. It was truly a magnificent thing, and if the rumors were true, they could fill it with water and create a giant ocean wherever they pleased! 
 
 They could finally snatch the surface from the humans! 
 
 He looked at his generals, who all understood what a day this was, and thrust the thing into the air, a vicious smirk spreading across his face. 
 
 “ Men, tonight we go to war! ”

 My whole life was planned out before it even began. What I would do, what I would be, even who I would be with. 
 
 That pretty little thing named Diane. Sure, she was nice, but that was it. There was nothing else in it, just like everything else. It was all just... nice. 
 
 I wanted more, but life is n't fair. So I kept working for them and living for her. Nothing was my own. 
 
 At this point you're probably thinking what right I have to complain. I was given everything. The dream of a happy life dropped right in my lap. All I need to do now is pop out a few kids to repeat the cycle and then they can finally put me in a hole to rest. Is this really everything? 
 
 `` Be thankful, Bob. Look what you ’ ve got'', `` Be careful, Bob. Don ’ t lost what you ’ ve got. ``, `` What's wrong, Bob? Aren ’ t you happy with what you ’ ve got?''

 I've grown tired of everything. Give it to someone else. Because although I'm surrounded by possessions which I say I adore and by people which say the same about me. I really do have nothing. So if you think about it, I ca n't really lose anything. 
 
 So I'll leave. No note, no trace. This damn town will be exactly the same. The only difference between today and tomorrow will be the lack of Bob's cash, the lack of Bob's clothes and the lack of Bob's meaningless husk.

 Now, looking at it all, John felt so *fucking* bored. 
 
 He wasn ’ t halfway through his route. He knew this by the navigation software installed on his low cost pile of shit craft, the ‘ Black Shield ’. Dumb name for a ship, but John didn ’ t pick it. It was bought and paid for after his military retirement, and he used it to ferry goods along the fringe territory. He ’ d been a solo contractor for about 3 years now, traversing space, alone. 
 
 He wanted a break from his cycle of sleep, eat, watching shows. He hadn ’ t talked to a person in about 3 weeks. Pinging his local area, John set a course for the nearest station. He looked at the building record. It was new, he hadn ’ t been there before. He always looked forward to getting drunk and cheery with some randoms. 
 John set his course. He decided to get some shut eye, as he knew his own temperament when he didn ’ t get enough sleep. Going back into his bunk area, he passed the 1st cargo bay. There was a rattle from the container. John didn ’ t pay it much mind, and kept walking to his bunk. He fell asleep looking forward to the prospect of some company. 
 
 **Hours later** 
 
 John docked with the station, stepping through the door. He felt the feel of gravity on his body, as weak as it was artificial. He dumped his traders bag in the lock box in the lobby, and stepped into the grey, titanium elevator. He never liked these pit stops. There was always a little effort to make it feel homely, like it was just a café back on earth or something, but this place was obviously new, as the walls were a cold, flat metal grey, with the odd monotone directional arrows across the station. 
 
 John stepped out of the elevator as the doors opened. The dining room was large, with many tables and booths for customers to sit and eat in privacy, with the bar at the back, and John could make out the kitchen behind the bar. He scanned the room for people, and saw a few, a couple were sitting at the booth in the corner, in the dark. They weren ’ t looking at each other, only their food. There were two older men sitting at the bar, nursing a small glass of what looked like vodka. An old woman, in her late eighties, sat in silence. The room was oddly tense, and john felt uneasy. 
 
 He walked forward to the bar, trying to make eye contact with the others in the room. He walked up near the two at the bar drinking, and craned his head, looking for the bartender. 
 * “ hello? Im just tryin to get a drink round he- ” * John stopped as he got a better look at one of the men along the bar, his eyes were dark and his nose was bleeding. Something was fucked. The man who was bleeding shook his head, not looking at him, staring down at his drink. 
 
 * “ hands in the fuckin air ” * a woman ’ s voice rang out. John turned, slowly, to face her. She was skinny, her dark, unkempt hair barely reaching her neck, wild eyed, and holding a 12 shot chrome hand cannon right between his eyes. He smiled at her. 
 
 * “ John!? Fuck, I ’ ve been lookin for you everywhere ” *

 I have n't felt a woman's touch in years. All I want is an escape. This reality has nothing left for me. So I decided to use the magic of technology for the answer. 
 
 I was a skinny, average looking nerdy thirty year old with no social skills. I do n't know why women did n't like me. It was just how my life was, I guess. Fate had dealt me a bad hand. I needed to get away from this life. So I came up with a solution. 
 
 I'm sure you've heard of the game `` The Sims,'' if you have n't heard of it before, I'll give you a brief run-through. It's a game where you create your own reality, your own family, and make them thrive. The perfect life. Where talking to a woman is as easy as saying `` Hoonai!'' and they're instantly infatuated with you. If you cheat on her, all you have to do is highfive her until she feels better about you. And there is no restrictions. You can learn and become anything. 
 
 So it would be my escape. 
 
 I learned how to map your neurons into technology, specifically into `` The Sims'' it took years of coding, but I was finally able to do it. I created an in game item called the `` Neurochamber'' and created one at the outside world as well. All of my money, except the rent on a small storage unit, went into this device. It was time. Today was my day. 
 
 I created my perfect situation first. First, my avatar, handsome, well built, full skill set. Then, my beautiful wife, Scarlet, with bright red hair, extremely intelligent, and a body to match. No kids. I hate kids. But all my friends were extremely intelligent, hot females too, so if things did n't work out with Scarlet, I would have options. 
 
 So, it was finally the time. I put myself into the Neuralchamber, set it to self-sustaining, and started the program. Finally, I would have a perfect life. Finally, an escape. 
 
 The machine whirred on, I shut my eyes, and the program started. 
 
 I stepped out of the chamber. The world looked different, pixalated, but slowly it went into higher resolution. This could mean one thing, it was aligning with my brain, raising its processing power. I had foreseen this coming, and it brought me a special joy. Pixels were n't as sexy as reality, but this was more of a mixture. A sort of CGI. I was in the living room of my new house. Perfect, just like how I left it in game. I bleeped on the computer connected to the Neuralchamber, and saw my body sitting, sleeping inside, in case of emergencies. It could last there forever for all I care. 
 
 I was finally home. 
 
 My wife approached to greet me. `` Heegah!'' she shouted, giving me a small, robotic wave. I tried to remember how to greet her, but I realized something. 
 
 I do n't speak Simmish, the in-game language. 
 
 It's okay, it's okay. I could learn from a book. So I went to the library and I picked one up and started to read. I saw a small loading bar above my head, near a floating emerald indicating I was the character in play. When I continued to read, I heard a *ding*. `` My intelligence increased!'' I shouted. My wife came in from the kitchen, with a bizarre look on her face. Deep thought. She was a smart one. 
 
 Then suddenly the graphics of the world went even higher resolution. It almost looked real. 
 
 `` Real...'' Scarlet said in perfect English. *Uh oh. * 
 
 `` Hus-band... Am I... not... real?'' I quickly got up from my chair in the library and came to her side hugging her gently. She did n't hug back. 
 
 `` You're real to me, sweetheart,'' I said reassuringly. She smiled and left the library, closing the door behind me. I shook the funny feeling I had and continued reading. 
 
 A loud sound like a spinning fan came from downstairs. 
 
 Someone turned on the Neuralchamber. 
 
 *Oh no. * I thought. *Oh no no no. * 
 
 I ran downstairs as quick as I could. Scarlet was sitting inside the Neural chamber built for me. 
 
 `` Scarlet!'' I shouted, trying to pry open the chamber's door. No budge, just like I built it. 
 
 I watched the computer screen. My body began to stir. Scarlet now inhabited it. I was furious, but fearful. I shouted into the intercom. `` Scarlet, get back in here right now! Push the return key! You do n't know what you're doing!'' 
 
 Scarlet stopped examining her new form and smiled into the camera set up in the Neuralchamber. She made a small wave and pushed the power button dramatically. She spoke as I disappeared, and the Sim world with me. 
 
 `` Soon-Soon!''

","Apologies for any errors in formatting, mobile is not the greatest for writing. 
 
 Mary 
 
 `` Let me out!'' I shouted, kicking the door, turning the knob and slamming all my weight into it. Pointless, as the three bullies had piled their ( considerable ) bodies against the door. 
 
 `` Say it, four-eyes! Three times, loud enough for us to hear!'' 
 That was Davy, the biggest, the meanest, and leader of the three. Unfortunately, although rather fittingly, he was also the ugliest. His size and misshapen face gave rise to the nickname Big Ugly, though that was only said in hushed voices behind his back. Those that he beat for this insult often resembled his lumpy face. 
 
 `` Yeah creep-freak, shout it out as loud as your prepubescent girl's voice can!'' 
 That was Ronald, who in no small way resembled the popular food chain's clown mascot. Seriously, a goofy face, tall and lanky, with bright red poofy hair? His parents must have seen'Hey McDonald, gim me some fries' in his future. The only reason people stopped calling him that was because of his head sized fists. 
 Creep-freak was his specialized insult for me, on account of my love for horror and low social status. 
 His voice was n't any deeper than mine, by the way. 
 
 The last guy, Harold, merely grunted a strange laugh. Calling Harold dumb was a bit much. Simple was a far better term. Not much smaller than Davy, Harold was a brute. Simple-minded, hairy, and large. The thing was, he was a good guy. He never meant any ham and helped anyone who asked, but due to his simplicity, he was taken advantage of, namely by Davy and Ronald. 
 
 `` Three times pipsqueak, then you get out,'' said Davy, punctuating it with his hyena laugh. 
 
 I groaned loudly, kicked the door, then shouted'fine'. 
 Turning away from the door and facing the mirror, I hunched over the sink. My long, bleach blond hair hung over my windowed, emerald eyes. 
 `` Assholes,'' I grumbled. `` Here we go: bloody Mary!'' 
 Nothing 
 `` Bloody Mary!'' 
 Still nothing. 
 I drew in a breath. I'm not superstitious, but I do love horror, and this was turning out just like a cruddy short story or flick. 
 `` Bloody Mary!'' 
 Nothing. I waited several long seconds. Still nothing. 
 
 `` You dead four-eyes?'' Called Davy. 
 
 `` No, jackass, nothing even remotely sca-'' 
 I stopped. A strange rumbling had began. It grew and grew until the whole room was violently shaking, as if a magnitude 8.0 earthquake had targeted the bathroom. 
 The shaking was powerful enough to put me on my ass, and, terrifying, I did the only logical thing: I climbed into shower. My glasses fell off my face, but I did n't care. I focused on safety, and cowered in the shower. The lights flickered like fire in strong winds. 
 Three things happened simultaneously. 
 The lights shut off, total darkness. 
 The shaking stopped, total stillness. 
 There were no sounds, total silence. 
 Nothing but ringing silence and murky blackness for half of an eternity. 
 The lights dimmed back on, barely enough to see. 
 Slowly, one sound began to emerge. 
 A steady drip... drip... drip. 
 A pale hand clamped on the corner of the shower, spattering the wall with a thick, dark liquid. 
 A black shape moved in lieu of the hand. Darker than night, dripping wet, silent. 
 Evil. 
 The shape turned slightly, pale skin glowing from under what I know understood to be raven colored hair. 
 Two sinister glints, the only things that could be taken for eyes, affixed themselves upon me. 
 
 You who called my name thrice, 
 Who cowers better than mice, 
 I ask only this of thee: 
 Why have you called me? 
 
 The voice was raspy, whispering, seemingly both in my ear and in front of me. It felt like something was ripping at my soul. My vision was shaky, blurry. 
 
 SPEAK BEFORE I CLAIM A PRICE 
 ANY ANSWER SHALL SUFFICE. 
 
 `` I-I was forced t-to. By t-the b-b-bullies,'' 
 My voice was shaking, my teeth chattering. 
 This was something unnatural, powerful. 
 
 Nasty nasty boys 
 Treating others like toys. 
 You called me unwillingly 
 Forced to, unknowingly. 
 I have a price to pay 
 Or I do not play, 
 But I am not cruel 
 Those treated as a tool 
 May sic me 
 On their enemy. 
 
 `` O-okay. S-sure, whatever you say just please do n't h-hurt me Miss Mary,'' 
 I cowered, stuttered, and bowed in fear. 
 
 Excellent, young one. 
 Do not fear, you've won. 
 Do not be a sheep 
 It is time to reap. 
 
 She vanished with a hissing laugh.

","`` Excuse me...'' I waved halfheartedly to the bartender. He glanced over at me and nodded, busy with other customers. I slumped back in my seat and waited. My fingers tapped upon the glossed wooden bar with one hand, the other propping my head up. Without my noticing, a figure took a seat beside me. 
 
 I glanced over slowly, swinging my head in full to complete the action. I found myself looking at an unmistakable crimson facade, who seemed more interested in the young woman on his other side. She turned around coquettishly, but recoiled upon his recognition. The devil sighed as she turned away. 
 
 The bartender slid a drink my way. `` Hey, and another one!'' I smiled, fashioning myself as clever. He nodded sullenly and slid another my way. I pushed the glass to the devil. `` Hey man, looks like you've had a rough time.'' 
 
 He looked over at me apologetically. `` Oh, sorry about this. Usually when I go out I'm a bit more collected... T-thanks for the drink, though.'' Within a second it was gone. He extended a hand. `` Lucifer, by the way... I'm sure you already knew that, though.'' I looked at him blankly as I shook his hand, mostly because I was too drunk to think how to respond. He panicked, `` I mean, not to be presumptuous or anything, not trying to act like a celebrity or anything like that, hahah...'' 
 
 He stared down. `` You know, you seem drunk enough to take a chance. Want to make a deal?'' I chuckled a bit. 
 
 `` Pshh, fuck that man. There are some things that you just do n't do, like using a Ted Cruz bumper sticker.'' I made myself laugh. Lucifer sighed. 
 
 `` Look, whenever I make a deal, it keeps me going, you know? It gives me a boost, and I need some deals. Even if they are n't good ones for me... Listen, you've been pretty cool, how about this. Name one thing you really want.'' 
 
 `` Really?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, just name something and I'll write you up a real nice deal. Go ahead!'' He gestured for me to think. It did n't take long to figure out what I wanted. 
 
 `` Alright, I want a thousand, fully functioning just like the ones in Aladdin, genie lamps. Three wishes each, but no boundaries. Also, I want immortality, but only for as long as I want it.'' 
 
 He looked down, slighly shocked. `` What the fuck, how am I supposed to... Okay okay, what will you give me though?'' 
 
 I scratched at my beard. `` Hmm, I guess I could give you a few of my lamps.'' It seemed like a pretty fair offer. 
 
 He looked at me for a few moments, then at the bar counter. `` This is so fucking stupid...'' He waved the bartender down for a few drinks, finishing them as soon as they were delivered. `` Alright, let's do this.'' 
 
 A small contract materialized on the bar, with far fewer words than what one would imagine. In fact, it was just a few sentences stating what would happen, no clauses or conditions to be found. He looked at me nervously. `` It looks good, right? No funny business, just need a signature. Please...'' I looked at him, and shrugged. Seemed pretty damn straightforward, and I guess I just lucked out to find him when he broke down. 
 
 I signed my name away, and watched the paper consume itself in flames as my pen left the paper. Lucifer grinned ear to ear. 
 
 `` You wo n't regret this, I promise!'' He ran off. 
 
 `` Hey man, where's my shit at?'' I yelled at him as he ran out. `` God damnit...'' 
 
 Later that night, I stumbled from my cab to my apartment building, and slowly made the ascent up the stairs to my place. As I opened the door, gleaming brass greeted me. Thousands of small lamps were scattered throughout my house. In the middle was an ornate table, adorned with obsidian and crimson. A small letter stood propped in the middle. I opened it. 
 
 *Dear Marc, I wanted to thank you for taking a chance and signing that deal. This should be good enough for a while. Unfortunatly, I could n't do the immortality thing, that's beyond what I'm capable of right now. I'll get it to you eventually though, dead serious. The genies should do it for now, just make sure you walk them and keep them fed. We'll be in touch. -Lucifer. * 
 
 I shrugged, grabbing a lamp and heading off to my room.

170991,"[ WP ] The most objectively good hero has the most terrifying power . Write a day in the life of his nemesis .
","His fingers drummed back and forth across his knuckles, long and spindly, like the hammers of a piano. There was nothing remarkable about the man, in and of itself, nor about the office around him, from the beige shutters and wood paneling to the American flags in their stands in the corners. On his desk was a small plaque that said, `` R. Mannisfield, Director of Operations.'' 
 
 Shuffling through some papers, brown eyes behind thick, hornrimmed glasses scanned across headers and titles. Names of men with brief descriptions gave him insight as to where the reports came from, though the coded terminology and phrases would be meaningless to an outsider. There were stacks of clipped papers across his simple desk, each of them containing nuggets of information collected from across the globe, funneled back through networks built by him into his hands. 
 
 In truth, he was little more than a paper pusher. His heyday of scientific research and advancement had long since passed, and the leadership that had once ordered him was now his to command. At his heed, their organization had spanned the globe and delved into depths of the world no one had ever dreamed existed. Both the ordinary world and the so-called `` other'' world were his for scrutiny like no other person on the planet, of this he was confident. 
 
 Pausing in leafing through the stacks, he adjusted his glasses as he silently read the markers of a report he had been waiting on. Across the top of the page were the words, `` Ukraine Facility memorandum; RE: ETE 001-b Codename: Pandora status update.'' 
 
 Suppressing a thin smile of triumph, he began swiftly skimming the report. The contents were concise, the commander in charge of the operation had hardly been a poet, and the message quickly became clear. Reading through it again with more care, the bespectacled man began with a frown of puzzlement that turned sallow as dread entered his gut. 
 
 `` Target located... Splinter-group team sighted... Splinter team unaware of presence... Splinter team discover ETE-001... Splinter team departs... Advance squad investigates, discovers ETE-001... In process of extraction when containment vessel broke... ETE-001 attacked and destroyed advance squad... Secondary squads attempt containment, when second enemy force attacks...'' 
 
 Pinching his eyes, the Director did n't need to read the rest. He knew what had happened. They had been too late. The connection between ETE-001b and 001a had been established, and the containment solution had failed. Even as it began to dawn on him what it would mean, someone hammered on his door. 
 
 `` Enter,'' he said in a level voice. 
 
 A panicked private burst into the room holding a small sheaf of papers. Hurriedly throwing a salute, he did n't wait to dart forward and drop the report on the Director's desk, before turning stiff and throwing another salute. 
 
 Saying nothing to the private, the Director quickly scanned the front page of the report. When a twisted smile appeared on his lips, the private blinked in surprise, but said nothing. A chuckle sent a tremor through the Director's thin shoulders, several more chortles escaping him like a car backfiring. 
 
 `` They're free now,'' he murmured as his giggling subsided. `` We've failed. They've gone free.'' 
 
 Setting the papers down, the private could read the words, `` CATASTROPHIC LOSSES'' in bold red letters across the top page. Most of the report had been personnel losses regarding another of their research facilities, though from what little the private had gleaned when the report arrived, there was no longer a facility to worry about. The base had gone silent more than two days before, and when reinforcements made it out to them, they found only a smoldering crater. 
 
 Picking up the report he had just been reading, the Director laid it side by side this fresh one. It was no surprise, now. The first had no doubt gotten free on his own, and escaped to rescue his sister. And now they were both loose in the world. 
 
 `` Have you heard of the Pandora's Box Program, private?'' the Director asked aloud as he mused to himself. 
 
 `` No, sir,'' was the quick reply. 
 
 `` Pandora's Box was the codename for a pair of supernaturals that were brought into custody in the early sixties. I oversaw the project myself, it was my last research project, in fact. They were... extraordinary. In every way. Their power was... infinite. Truly infinite. The only chains that held them back were their ignorance and their innocence. They did not know what they could do, and we kept them from experimenting for themselves. There was... no force that could destroy them, we discovered. We could only lock them away. Try to keep the world safe from them. Then, while our organization went through its schism in the seventies, the location of one of the two supernaturals was lost, only recently having been rediscovered.'' 
 
 `` What could they do?'' the private asked slowly, quickly remembering, `` Sir?'' 
 
 `` *Anything, *'' the Director said in a strained whisper. `` Their dreams could become our reality. They exist on a plane we only brush against, and their connection to the universe is unlike anything we can hope to match. For all intents and purposes... they are *gods. *'' 
 
 Leaning back in the padded leather chair, the Director rested his fingers on his chin, staring at nothing as he planned. He seemed to have forgotten about the private standing awkwardly at attention before him, before finally dismissing him with a small wave. 
 
 Rotating the chair as the private hurried out, the Director peered through one of the picture windows behind his desk. A sigh built in him, and was released slowly through his nose as he stared out at a world that was on the verge of a fresh new apocalypse.

10862,"[ WP ] You paint a person , and it comes to life . It ca n't leave the canvas , and it begs you to add things to the painting .
","I just finished painting a beautiful woman with long flowing chestnut hair when something terrifying happened. She got up from where she was laying on the floor walked closer to the canvas. Well from a perspective that's what it looks like she is doing but in actuality she moves her legs and her body takes up more of the blank canvas. 
 I rub my eyes furiously and look around to make sure no one was playing some convoluted prank on me. Finding no one I snatched my coffee cup from the table and stare into the black liquid. `` Coffee, you have betrayed me for the last time.'' I pronounce raising the cup to dash it on the floor. 
 `` Goodness, why are artists always so dramatic?'' I look around the room again my eyes threatening to pop and turn back to the painting. `` Yes, I spoke you snobby hipster. I could n't just let you waste that good coffee, I would literally kill for a cup of coffee.'' She looks down at her naked body. `` And some clothes you perv, what exactly is this painting supposed to be about?'' 
 `` I-I was going to paint a furry dog the s-same color as your hair laying down n-next to you.'' I stammer. `` The painting will evoke a feeling of-'' `` Yea, yea, yea, stop with all that pretentious bullshit. You're not impressing anyone.'' She interjects sharply. Now I've been critiqued negatively alot in my time as an artist and taken it in stride but something about being critiqued that way by my own painting cuts deep. `` Look, just lay back down and let me finish the painting its not even done yet, you should n't pass judgement until you see the final work!'' I blurt nasally from my reddening face. She rolls her eyes but thankfully returns to her position. 
 `` Like this?'' `` No, no, your right arm was higher.'' I say tapping the canvas where the arm was previously. `` Has it occurred to you that maybe I gained consciousness from bearing the pain of this uncomfortable position?'' She mutters. I frown at the pale figure in the middle of the white canvas, `` Just hold still, its going to be great. You'll see.'' I begin painting quick deft strokes on the canvas beside her when she complains, `` You're ruining my hair.'' I impatiently shush her and continue painting. A short while later a curly haired dog lays on the ground beside her fully realized. `` Put some coffee in my left hand and you can title this Saturday morning.'' She quips from next to the huge dog with a wooden comb in its fur. I blink, `` Yea that is a good idea.'' `` And do something about this blank canvas. Paint me in a cozy living room.'' 
 `` This is my work.'' I say suddenly irked. She jumps up at that, rips the comb from the dogs fur, snaps it to a point with her teeth and holds it to the dogs neck. `` Coffee, then living room or the dog gets it.'' I gasp looking into the big brown eyes of the whimpering dog and quickly set about painting in some coffee. `` You think I'm going to go all the way over there to get it? Paint it closer!'' She yells shaking the dog. I quickly paint a coffee at her feet and set about painting in background colors of the living room. `` Look I'm doing what you say just do n't hurt the dog!'' And people say they suffer for their art, I think to myself as my paintbrush slicks quickly across the canvas. 
 `` How did it come to this, my art holding itself for ransom.'' I whisper painting in shadows as quickly as I can muster. Soon the living room is complete and I sigh in relief. `` There, all done now, let the dog go.'' I say to the woman. 
 She stabs the dog. `` Noo!'' I yell at the canvas as the dog twitches. `` You take your art way too seriously.'' She chides as she wipes her bloody shiv off on the dogs now still fur. `` Arrrgh!'' Rage over comes me as I grab my palette and quickly shape out a large Rottweiler head with a mean look. She runs over and stabs it quickly. The blurry head falls to the ground its in-descript colors pooling on the floor. 
 `` Have n't you ever tried speed painting? You're going to have to be faster than that.'' She chuckles mockingly. I pick up another brush and dip it into the orange dab on my pallete. `` Lets see how fast you are.'' I say grinning wickedly. I wiggle the paint brush on the bottom of the canvas and top little ovals with swirly points. `` You monster!'' She gasps in realization and runs to the side of the canvas vanishing past the edge. I stop painting the flames in a bit of a shock at this new found revelation and press my face to the canvas attempting to see past the side of the painting. 
 `` Yaaaaaaah!'' She yells as she rushes my face. The comb swipes before I can react and arcs at my throat. `` Arggh! `` I cry jerking from the painting and dabbing at the side of my neck. Brown paint stains my finger tips and I narrow my eyes at her. Slashing black borders around the edge of the canvas I resume painting the flames. 
 `` Noooo!'' She shrieks panic. Running to the right side of the canvas she slams into the black border and she does the same on the left. The flames are taking a life of their own now too but I keep painting them. `` I will have my revenge you bastard! If you ever paint again, I will be there!'' She starts to scream as the flames lick her body and I paint one right over her. Her screams only last another second and the painted flames devour the rest of the canvas within the black borders. I watch until the flames stop moving and wipe the sweat off my brow. `` Susan!'' A voice startles me. I jump before I recognize it as the paintings' commissioner. `` What is this?'' He says looking at the work from under his creased brow. I look back to the painting. `` Umm, its an abstract piece?'' I try. `` I love it!'' He exclaims approaching the peice and stirring the air around with his hands. `` The anguish, the rage! You ca n't tell just from a glance what emotions it's supposed to convey! Beautiful! I'll take it now, is it dry?'' I touch the black outline and one of the flames in the middle. `` Umm, yes. Yes it is.'' `` Excellent, I will expect more paintings from you in the future!'' He says and jauntily walks out of the room with it. 
 `` More paintings? Aw, fuck.''

20853,"[ WP ] The Princess kidnapped The Dragon . Who , if anyone , shows up to rescue him ?
","Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a princess scowled at the newspaper. Another of her friends had been kidnapped. Another! that made six this month. She tore the thing neatly in two and almost threw it at her handmaiden, declaring, `` this has to stop. I mean, is n't life difficult enough for princesses without the constant threat of kidnap hanging over our heads?'' 
 
 The maid raised a delicate eyebrow, her thoughts turning to her own difficulties, so far removed from those of her employer, `` highness, I do n't think there's anything to be done about it...'' she complained. 
 
 This was met with a disparaging look from Princess Ellionora, who rose to her feet, dislodging one of the flowers in her hair with a sudden head movement. It landed on the floor beside the train of the girl's gown, `` you do n't... you do n't think... look, from the reports I've been reading, it seems that it's always the same dragon. Big thing, green scales, breathes fire. What's he doing, collecting royal girls? What for? am I expected to just sit around waiting to see if he decides to add -me- to his collection?'' 
 
 The maid looked away, unable to meet her eyes, `` if Your Highness will excuse me...'' she mumbled. Ellie waved a hand and the girl scurried out of the room. After she was gone, Ellie allowed herself a little sigh and started thinking. Thinking, that gravest of sins. Princesses, she knew, were n't supposed to think. The concern was that thinking too much could give a girl wrinkles, but it was a sin Ellie was fond of committing. So the green dragon was collecting princesses and had at least six already. The most recent one was her friend from finishing school, Princess Delilah of the neighbouring kingdom of Greenvaria, that same Greenvaria who's prince Ellie was already betrothed to. She could only wonder how concerned her fiance must be. There were posters all over the walls in town, promising half-kingdoms and royal wives to any man who could rescue any princess, and the castle had already been on lockdown for weeks for her protection and that of her younger sister, Nemaria. Ellie could n't take it anymore. Something, she mused, had to be done. 
 
 But what? 
 
 Truth be told, Ellie was n't sure, but she knew it had to be something big, something drastic. Just thinking about it, she was already being a bad, bad girl. She wondered how far she could push it. If her own fears of kidnap could ever truly be assuaged by anything other than marriage ( nobody ever seemed inclined to kidnap a queen, after all ). She clicked her fingers, then walked to the wardrobe, an idea occuring to her. Revenge. Revenge might be the way forward. It took a few seconds to locate her riding clothes, and perhaps an hour to change her attire without help. She tied her long, flowing blonde hair back with the ribbon from her dress and pushed the door open a crack. She realised she'd need a sword. Dragon-slaying princes always had swords, after all. Though she had no idea how to use one. She decided it did n't really look very difficult, that the hard part would be stealing one and getting out of her securely guarded home. She sneaked out into the hallway, finding it comfortingly deserted, then started off to the staircase. A handful of castle servants passed, but bore her no mind. The huge, carved wooden doors were in sight. She made a beeline for them, only to be stopped by the captain of the guard 
 
 `` Going out for a ride, Your Highness?'' he asked, adding, in a suspicious tone, `` I thought you had to sit in court with your parents this morning?'' 
 
 Ellie did n't hesitate. She knew she'd need to get her hands dirty at some point, and if she could n't handle Guardsman Phillips, then she probably could n't handle a fully grown dragon either. She mustered up as much strength as she could and.. hesitated. She could n't do it. Maybe she could talk her way out, `` I wanted to take a ride before court. Get some fresh air, and exercise my horse a little. Be gone maybe an hour...'' she told him 
 
 Hee shook his head, `` not without an escort, your father's orders. Princess Delilah was kidnapped last night, and considering how close Greenvaria is to us, everyone's worried that you'll be kidnapped too.'' 
 
 She nodded, realising that she'd need to somehow lose the escort. That would be difficult. She made herself smile as brightly as she could and quite openly lied to the guard, `` that would be wonderful. I dislike riding alone, after all'' 
 
 He let her pass, and she crossed the courtyard under the watchful eye of courtiers and guards alike. Everyone was watching her more closely than usual, it seemed. She was n't surprised by this. Ellie realised that her escort would probably be waiting for her at the stables. That, then, was the last place she wanted to go, and the one place she had to appear to be going. She slipped behind a pavilion and attempted to climb it, but princesses were never taught practical skills. Climbing seemed a bit more difficult than it looked. She had to give up on that idea. 
 
 The high, smooth walls that ringed the castle went pretty close to the pavilion, it was mostly used by travelling minstrels to add ambience to the courtyard, after all, and was, today, rather devoid of musicians. Today was not a special day. She appreached the wall and stared up it. It was at least twice as high as she could reach, and she already knew she could n't climb. She'd need to find another way. This involved turning and following it around in the hopes of finding a hole. Perhaps the hole her sister's commoner paramour used to sneak into the grounds. She'd seen him in the castle, so there absolutely had to be a way, a hole was her guess. 
 
 She found it eventually. It was a bit small for her to get through easily, so she crouced down and attempted to shimmy through. If she were n't a lady, she'd probably have sworn when she heard the'rrrrrrip' of soft fabric tearing on the weathered brickwork. Still, she made it, and as she leaned against the wall, heard the first sign that her absence was already noticed. Shouting, mostly. Time was definitely not on her side. She ran, bolting off towards the forest where she usually went riding. It was not a magical forest like the one in one of the neighbouring kingdoms proudly boasted having, it was n't even a huge forest. It was just... a woodland. She still had to work out how to acquire a sword and how to slay a dragon, though. Could n't be that hard, right? 
 
 Out of breath, and nursing a painful stitch in her right side, she eventually reached the forest. The sun was hanging high by now, suggesting that it was probably around noon. She'd been at this'escape' business for a long time, now. Slowing to a walk, she held her hands where it hurt and just focused on putting one foot in front of the other. 
 
 `` Would n't go that way if I were you,'' a voice from above her head called out. Ellie looked up, to see an adolescent boy standing on a tree branch. He jumped down to land in front of her, `` ere, are n't you wossname, Princess Thingie?'' he asked, sort of recognising her. 
 
 `` Princess Ellionora, and you are...?'' she asked, irritated at having been slowed down 
 
 `` Name's Dave, I'm a sorcerer's apprentice,'' he claimed, proudly holding up the bundle of ordinary looking leaves he'd harvested before noticing her 
 
 `` Do n't sorcerer's apprentices mostly just bewitch and then lose contol of mops?'' she asked, skeptically. 
 
 Dave winced, `` that's not fair! One apprentice does that once and suddenly it's all we do. You want me to start yelling that I've found you? there's knights in this forest. Looking for you. Why'd ya run away?'' 
 
 She attempted to walk past him, but he moved to block her, `` aint moving til you tell me why a spoiled princess who's never felt hunger in her life would want to leave her castle,'' he declared. 
 
 Irritated, Ellie snapped, `` I'm not spoiled!'' then, after amoment's pause, admitted, `` I want to slay the dragon who's been kidnapping my friends before he kidnaps me'' 
 
 Dave burst out laughing. While Ellie stood watching, somewhat beyond unimpressed, he finally stopped, `` yeah, you and what weapon, Princess? You aint got a sword and I doubt you can weild magic like my master can...'' 
 
 He had a point. That was tough to admit, she already disliked him, `` look, you can either help me, or step aside, I'm in a bit of a hurry.'' 
 
 Dave dropped his plants, `` alright. What'll it pay? Way I see it, princesses are rich, and being an apprentice does n't earn you anything. It's basically an internship.'' 
 
 The princess frowned, considering his question. She finally came to a decision, `` if you help me, and if we both survive, then when I am queen, I'll make you our court sorcerer,'' she promised, adding, `` provided you complete your studies'' 
 
 This seemed good enough. He nodded and held a grubby hand out to her. She stared at it for a moment, before remembering that the menfolk shook hands when they made a deal. Cautiously, she took his hand and gave it a shake. He spoke, `` deal. Look, I'm not powerful enough to kill a dragon, but I might be able to teach you a spell that will freeze it. Ca n't go with you, obviously. I have to be back in an hour or I'll get in trouble. Freeze the dragon and you can do what you want to him. Basic spell, learned it on my first day'' 
 
 Ellie was skeptical, `` I'm not a witch, I'm a princess,'' she grumbled. 
 
 `` Difference between witches and princesses is in upbringing. Anyone can do magic if they set their mind to it,'' he told her, holding both hands up, `` wave your hands like this,'' he demonstrated, `` and say'frigidus', but really concentrate on it, put some effort in. It'll get you half an hour of frozen whatever, but you can do it again if you need to'' 
 
 Ellie raised her hands, uncertain if the spell would work. Still, she needed to try, it was better than her own ill-thought-out scheme, after all. Concentrating as hard as she could, she waved her hands and declared, `` frigidus''

125062,"[ WP ] A group of explorers find the entrance to a massive bunker in the mountains . Inside they find a makeshift barricade and hundreds of skeletons . They then realize the barricade is facing deeper into the tunnels .
","22:00. Dark has fallen all around us and temperatures have dropped. 
 
 We were elated to find a cave in the depth of night. John alone had the foresight to pack a torch, and that seems to have been our saving grace. Our small band had been following a babbling stream for hours in an easterly direction, although it took frequent twists which makes true navigation quite difficult. Hope was all but lost by 22:33 when the lamp's light happened to catch, and be subsequently swallowed in the tight mouth of a small cave. It appears to have been carved into the rock by an overflow channel of water prevalent in the rain season. This was pure conjecture, based off the fact that no water flowed it's way presently. After brief deliberation, a unanimous decision was reached. This was our best, if not only, course of action. We made our way towards the mouth, and with a fair bit of strenuous effort, we were within it. Some peace was to be found and even a brief period of sleep, but the morning still holds extreme difficulties for us. I will sign off now, for a brief period. One must let the body rest. Especially in circumstances as stressful as these. It is now just reaching 23:44. Goodnight. 
 
 03:23. I awoke with a start. A cool draft flows through our temporary home and creates an ominous, woeful wailing 
 
 I looked all around me and could discern the shapes of my two companions fast asleep at my either side. Even in the oppressive dark, the rise and fall of John's chest was apparent. Steady rhythm and deep breaths. I envy his ability to sleep. We have known each other for the majority of our lives, and I am comfortable in proposing that he could easily sleep through the end of times. The Four Horseman have little in comparison to the depth of his REM cycle. 
 
 John is a tall man of significant stature. His large frame carries a vast labyrinth of sinewy muscle which makes him an intimidating prospect to most mortals. I suppose that has something to do with how easily he finds rest. His skin appears fairly weathered, but not prematurely aged, and carries a relatively dark complexion. His unruly hair is dark enough to be considered black, and contrasts with deep, cool blue eyes that glisten with mischief. He is my closest friend as well as one of the staunchest survivalists I have ever met. Which is fortunate for myself, and our other companion, Robert. 
 
 Robert had laid his bedroll to my right. Carefully placed so that his feet faced the cave entrance. I am not proficient in psychological evaluation, but if I know Rob, it has everything to do with keeping away from possible danger. He is the true vision of caution, to the point of absurdity. A fact that John loves to rub in his face. Robert lacked John's incredible size and most of his athleticism. However, he compensated for it with an intellect that could make Einstein look foolish. Robert stands only 65'' tall and looks like a Weasley. Percy to be more precise, and equally as uptight. Pale skin made green eyes seem even more vibrant, and for all the mischief found in John's eyes, Robert had cunning in his own. His sleep seemed more labored. Breaths came and dissipated in waves. He stirred occasionally. 
 
 Neither, however, had as much trouble sleeping as I. At first, I listened to the steady wailing of the wind through the cave between their slumberous breaths, and envied them. That is until about 04:25, when I experienced the first Anomaly. It occurred just as a mighty snore escaped Robert and caused John to stir in his cadaverous sleep. 
 
 
 04:25. A clatter from further within the cave, followed by a brief hesitation in the wailing breeze. 
 
 I almost thought I heard a low, rumbling growl as well, but I attribute that to nerves. Even so, I made a mental note to investigate further once my party had awoken. Perhaps I'm just being ridiculous. Fear can poison a man's mind. And I am certainly not too proud to admit that our predicament left me terrified. Time drifted by as my mind continued to wander, and eventually my eyes grew heavier. Soon I found sleep once more. 
 
 05:52. I no longer wonder whether or not there is something else in this cave. Another noise sprang from deeper in the tunnel, and this time it was enough to wake John and Robert. We have agreed to look into the occurrence. 
 
 As I rolled my sleeping bag, I began to wish we were readying to go anywhere else. I would even have preferred to head back into the wilderness from which we had come. Call it intuition, or even just cowardice if you like. This felt wrong. Like we might be getting ourselves into much more than we could handle. I pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind. Terror was of no use here. I had to at least make an attempt to feign confidence. At 06:13 we began to travel behind John's light. We continued along this way, as quickly as we could for about twenty minutes. At which point we encountered the second Anomaly. 
 
 06:36. Corpses. Stripped of flesh, and still clutching their weapons. A grisly scene of some past horror that we do n't understand. 
 
 Words fail me. I wish my eyes would have failed me as well. Bones littered the floor of this cave. It is nearly impossible to imagine the last moments the bones endured. One thing that is certain, is that several of these corpses seem to have been eviscerated by some unknown force. All of the curiosity that pushed me further into this cave has fled my mind. I would now gladly take the uncertainty of a hostile landscape than the certainty of a lethal shelter. We turned to flee, but a shrill scream-like growl stopped us in our tracks. It echoed off the walls. It chilled my blood. It was the beginning of the end.

 `` How did you not know she had a boyfriend?'' Avan asked with astonishment, `` I mean you were practically demanding for that slap when you told her that she was dead-drop gorgeous right after her grandmother's funeral.'' 
 
 `` I do n't know,'' I said, `` She just seem pretty and nice and figured it was worth a shot to request a date.'' 
 
 `` Request a date?'' Avan laughed, `` Good luck with that, she never picks up guys from bars.'' 
 
 I shrugged in a defeated motion and went my separate way. To live in a world where everyone knows whose available, where the social and dating preferences of others were seen on first contact, where everyone can find that perfect someone quickly without the hassle of questioning and courting. This seemed like paradise to most people, but not to someone like me. 
 
 Dating was still a mystery to me, everyone else, such as Avan could pick up a date in a heartbeat, stating that it was just a simple *knowing* to understand when they were available. He tried to show me the subtle clues to *knowing*, but no matter how hard I worked, I could not simply understand when someone was interested in me.

","Very few of us exist. 6 are created every 5 years. And each is endowed with a very special gift. We're all unique in our ability. But we each carry a burden. We're effectively immortal. We can not die of natural causes. We can be killed, however. I've seen many guardians fall. And when one falls, it triggers a natural disaster. However, three of ours are different.

And I'd the three of us are killed at the same time, it triggers doomsday. Everyone else has an expiration date, born organically. Not us.

The powerful know of our abilities and want to try to harness it for themselves, but they do n't know that we're not human. An organic body ca n't handle that much raw energy. We've watched humans screw up what we try to build. Mountains, forests, and Meadows all ruined by the greed and arrogance of humans. But we know that the men who did this are fast approaching their expiration dates. And when they do, we're the reapers who take them back. It is not our place to judge them, merely to bring them before God to be judged. I've seen countless hearings and seen multiple souls damned to hell. It's quite a sight.

207790,"[ OT ] 1,001 Science Fiction Story Prompts
","> This is my first post to this sub, I used a prompt from this page. 
 
 I looked out the side window and saw the front of several small shops, I thought to myself about how glad I was too move out away from the big city and into a small, well-aged, friendly town. The store fronts looked aged not only from the worn down textures but also from the dated signs, the carved wood branding the shop with a name lovingly chosen years ago. Lights visible from the inside shining outwards in deep contrast to the dark quiet night, not as I had known it in the city. The town housed no more than four thousand people, all of whom it is my job to protect, I smiled looking down at the shiny new badge on my chest. Turning off the main road I decided to go and check up on a small residential street. Looking out on the old houses littered among the more recent ones I noticed a man lying on the edge of the road. I parked my cruiser and step out, I sigh as the man is most likely a drunk “ I guess even out here they have them. ” I thought to myself as I approach the man lying dangerously close to the road. 
 
 “ Are you alright sir? ” I ask the man loudly to no response. I stand for a few seconds by the man once again asking if he is okay, he makes a faint groaning sound and turns his shoulder to me. “ Do you live in this house? ” I ask gesturing to the house closest to where he lay. “ No. ” he mumbles clearly annoyed by the whole ordeal. “ I ’ m afraid I ’ m going to have to ask you to leave. ” I inform him. “ Can ’ t I just go with you? ” He grumbles now sitting up. I decide to let him stay in the drunk tank as it is empty due to the low crime rate in the city, “ Alright. ” I confirm “ Get in the cruiser. ” I say as I gesture towards the state issued vehicle. Pulling himself up he gets to his feet and starts shuffling to the vehicle, the head lights illuminates his features allowing me to get a better look at him than I could while he sat in the shade. I am a little startled by the age of the man, he appears to be in his seventies despite the young powerful voice he possesses. I open the door for him before he slouches himself into the back passenger seat of the car. I get into my seat and as I buckle myself in tell him to do the same. I put the car into drive and return to the road, checking every so often on the man in the back seat. 
 
 The man says nothing for a while until I hear him start to murmur very fast, I am unable to make out any words as he is speaking too fast so I ask him what he is saying. “ Oh, I ’ m just muttering about how you should have been nicer to me. ” A slight shiver is sent down my spine with those words “ Why is that? ” I ask making sure not to stutter. “ Because I ’ m god. ” He replies without missing a beat. I begin to think that I may be dealing with a serious nut case so I make a mental note to give him a blood test when we get to the station. He sits quiet for a few more minutes until we start nearing the station “ I can prove it too. ” He calmly states, deciding that this isn ’ t a big deal I decide to play along to see where this leads “ Oh yeah, show me. ” I tease. With that our car teleports spontaneously into space, the peaceful town instantly replaced with vast oceans of stars. “ Whoa! “ I scream due to shock, not yet comprehending what happened, my heart starts beating at an extremely rapid rate as I gaze out upon the majesty of the universe, although at the time its beauty was over shadowed by fear. 
 
 “ Relax, I changed your body to no longer require air, pressure, or temperature. ” The man grins as if all this is all nothing. “ Behold your universe. ” God dictates as if by heart, “ Hmm, strange this part feels as though it ’ s losing its appeal, oh well. ” He mutters to himself in confusion. “ I am the only true life form and that is your galaxy. ” He recites as though he has a thousand times and is now sick of the usual spiel. “ I created you in my mind, well not only you, everyone is just an idea I thought of in my infinite complexity. ” He starts “ I do this all the time to pass my eternity of solitude, create illusions of life to spend my time with, it started with me creating only a few people but over time that board me. ” He explains. “ Over time my illusions became more complex more real, some might have been more real than me at times. Although their time span felt insignificant compared to my eons of life so once they reached a good place to stop I would destroy them and start again. ” I sat horrified as he told his story, not wanting to believe it I tried not to listen but felt compelled to anyway. “ Over time the creation became tiring and my thoughts turned ever more towards the destruction, prolonging it, accentuating it, on one universe I thought of creating hope within the beings I made inhabit it, it made their ending even more satisfying. ” Clinching my head I looked around the car for something to defend myself but to my dismay my weapons were removed from existence. “ Now the destruction is turning dull and my eons are beginning to pass more slowly… I think for this world I will try to do even worse. ”

110840,"[ IP ] A Castle in Spain
","Juan shivered and pulled his attention away from the castle and back to the American. 
 
 “ Officers with Russians in big house speak? More future campaigns perhaps? Supplies soon we hope. ” 
 
 The others chuckled and glanced slyly at each other. The American ’ s Spanish was terrible. It would always get a laugh, no matter the circumstances and had become a running joke among the men. Sometimes Juan suspected that he exaggerated his poor grasp of the language. He never had any trouble understanding the Spanish spoken around him. 
 
 “ The officers are meeting to make plans with the foreign advisors and request supplies, ” Juan responded. They ’ d better get resupply soon, too. They were short on everything. 
 
 “ I bet it ’ s warm in there, ” someone muttered. 
 
 “ I bet they have plenty of food, ” someone else added as the rest joined in. 
 
 “ And wine! ” 
 
 “ And women! ” 
 
 “ And hot baths! ” 
 
 “ And beds! ” 
 
 “ And women! ” 
 
 More laughter. No one got up from the fire to go to the castle. Warm as it looked, no one wanted to be near the Soviet advisors. The ranks were filled with stories about those who angered them and were later executed for spying for the enemy. If they wanted to aid the people ’ s revolution from the comfort of a warm castle they were free to do so as far as Juan was concerned, as long as he could be somewhere else. It was cold outside but they were safely cloaked in anonymity, beyond the gaze of the new lords inside. 
 
 Snow began to fall harder. Big, wet flakes hurtled recklessly to the ground as the men pulled coats and blankets tighter around themselves. They grew silent as they stared into the fire, occasionally glancing up at the castle looming above them. 
 
 The wind picked up and bottles appeared to be passed around the fire. “ Who builds castle? ” asked the American. Juan smiled to himself, noting that the American suddenly knew the word for “ castle. ” 
 
 “ Knights, ” a soldier said, “ to fight the Moors. ” 
 “ I heard it was the Romans to fight the Visigoths, ” another replied. Sensing a new distraction the rest of the men around the fire began to add their historical knowledge. 
 
 “ No, it was a wizard that did it, thousands of years ago. ” 
 
 “ A wizard? Are you a child? ” 
 
 “ It was Charlemagne and the Franks. ” 
 
 “ The Inquisition built it as a dungeon. They say that it ’ s still haunted by the ghosts of Jews and heretics. ” 
 
 The debate raged until the commander appeared out of the darkness and joined them around the fire. 
 
 “ Who built the castle? ” a chorus of voices asked. The commander was an educated man and his opinions carried weight in such matters. 
 
 “ Dead men, ” said the commander as he grabbed one of the bottles making a circuit around the fire. “ What ’ s more important is who ’ s in it now. ” 
 
 “ And who is that? ” Juan asked. 
 
 “ Assholes, ” the commander said before taking a pull from the bottle. “ Assholes and idiots. ” 
 
 “ Will the new campaign get us killed? ” 
 
 “ As usual, ” the commander took another drink and passed the bottle on. “ They ’ ll give us a bunch of ammunition for guns we mostly don ’ t have and send us to attack positions we couldn ’ t take with twice our numbers. They want to show the world we ’ re still fighting. They want to show their masters back home they ’ re doing their job. ” 
 
 Silence settled again. 
 
 “ Is the castle really haunted? ” a soldier ventured. The others laughed. Juan smiled and rolled his eyes. 
 
 The commander glanced at the speaker and shrugged. “ If anywhere is haunted, that place is. It ’ s filled with death. That ’ s why you build a castle. Give yourself a safe place to hide when you ’ re not out killing people. Or to send others to do the killing and dying for you. ” 
 
 “ Like it ’ s cursed, ” said the soldier. 
 
 “ Exactly, ” said another, “ cursed by the wizard that built it a thousand years ago. ” 
 
 The argument began again. 
 
 Juan shivered and pulled his coat closer. He looked up at the castle, thrusting up unto the evening sky like a bayonet. 
 
 The American leaned in close. “ Do we go to our deaths? ” 
 
 Juan nodded, not taking his eyes off the towers in the distance. “ We always do. ”

9644,"[ WP ] Your one of the guys who write the scripts for the dreams people have while sleeping . You got the latest `` time slot '' and are getting fed up by people waking up before the end of your masterpieces !
","Writing dreams is a piece art. I need to know and study my subject for months on end so that I can project their dreams and desires and produce their fears and anxieties. My stories need to inspire feats of awe while remaining grounded to reality enough to suspend disbelief. I don ’ t write cheap serials in pulp magazines or cheesy Reddit comments filled with dick jokes, I produce honest-to-God art, custom tailored to my subject, who by the end of it, should wake up with an applause on their hands and tears in their eyes. Instead, they just wake up before act 3. 
 
 How am I supposed to create meaningful characters and substantial plots when I can ’ t predict how long they ’ ll last? The aspiring novelist has no length requirement and the bold film makers know approximately how long their movies are supposed to show, yet I work with the impossible restriction of not knowing if my subject will finish their fantastical dream or simply wake up and continue with their dreary lives. But enough is enough. I performed the ritual known as the Dark Sacrament with blackened candles and a chant in the ancient language of angels. 
 
 Hinged upon the last verse of my chant, all the candles, perfectly lined into a circle, eradicated their flames. As fresh smoke and blackness filled the air, a being stood before me. Known as Hypnos to the ancient Greeks and as the Sandman to my contemporaries, the Lord of Sleep shook the earth around me and sedated me with heavy eyes. As if in a trance, I lied on the cold floor, only dimly aware of the dark figure veiled by the shadows. 
 
 “ You are Somnium, an author of dreams and appreciate to my brother, Morpheus, ” he spoke in gentle but harsh tones. “ Why do you summon me? ” 
 
 “ I want you to cast a spell, ” I answered. “ On Jonathan Davenport, my subject and white canvas. ” 
 
 “ What spell? ” he asked, intrigued. 
 
 “ Eternal sleep, ” I responded. “ He always wakes before my masterpieces complete. I want his mind to be a perpetual theater in which I air my dreams. I want to rule his mind with a never ending cascade of brilliant stories and powerful plots. ” 
 
 “ Interesting, ” the shadowy figure spoke with a hint of consideration poised in his voice. “ Somnium, I will do you this favor, on one condition. ” 
 
 “ I ’ m listening, ” I called to the Lord of Sleep. 
 
 “ I shall grant Jonathan rest and you shall write dreams, ” he began. “ But I shall visit every night. If your dreams please me, I shall extend the spell another day. If, however, I find your dreams dull or uneventful, Jonathan shall wake at the stroke of noon the next day. Understood? ” 
 
 ***** 
 
 As Jonathan woke to the sound of a screeching alarm, a dream filled with gods of sleep and dreams loitered in his head for a moment. Turning the alarm off, he gingerly rubbed his eyes and rose from bed, ready to begin another dreary day working in retail. As he dressed, he wondered why his dreams always ended at the best part.

","Only existing for about 100,000 years, Humans were a distinctly odd species. From the very beginning, humanity seemed to be driven by a desire to consume rather than assimilate or cohabitate. They killed beasts to put their furs around themselves for warmth, constructed dwellings by converting the plantlife around them, and continually dove deeper into their own planet for resources to fuel their growth. Eventually, as their planet started becoming more and more barren, they turned towards the one thing that they had in abundance: themselves.

","`` 84... c'mon c'mon! 85, 86,87.'' BAM!! 
 
 Martys' eyes flew open as the front of the DeLorean crumped up. `` F*ck! What the hell...'' Surprisingly, Marty was uninjured, though he knew it'd take lots of work to get the DeLorean running again... if Doc let him borrow it that was! Marty marched over to the blue box sitting in the middle of the road. Humming and other sounds were coming from the inside, and Marty wondered just why the hell a blue... police box, according to the writing, was doing in the middle of the street. 
 
 He banged on the door, and was quite shocked when a man opened it. `` Oh. Oh dear.'' The doctor looked at his car and shook his head. `` No, that wo n't do... I really must learn to park the TARDIS better...'' He sighed and shook his head. `` But that's not important right now. Apparently she thinks you're in danger, and so she and I, have come to save you.''

","When I finally reached the front of the long line, I stepped up to the absurdly tall podium, tilting my head back to gaze up at the shadowy figure standing behind it and staring down at me. 
 
 The creature leaned forward, its head sliding down on a long neck to stare down at me. I felt like a guilty schoolboy, pinned in place by a forbidding mistress. 
 
 Most schoolmarms, however, do n't have eyes filled with flames, giant venom-dripping spikes sticking out in a ruff around their heads, or scaly grasping fingers that end in terrifyingly long and sticky claws. 
 
 ***'' AND WHAT HEINOUS CRIME HAVE YOU-'' *** 
 
 The monstrous figure paused, turned its head, and let out several hacking coughs. `` Sorry about that, feather in my throat,'' it went on in a much more normal tone of voice. `` Anyway, what did you do to end up here?'' 
 
 I glanced around. I'd been vaguely hoping that this was just a test, that I was n't actually in Hell, but my hopes were rapidly fading. `` Um, I guess I stole a bunch of money,'' I fessed up. It did n't feel like nearly as big of a deal as it had when I was still alive, but I supposed that it had stuck me here. 
 
 The figure nodded. `` Oh, sure. Times are tough, need to feed the family, all of that, yes?'' 
 
 `` Well, no. I was a lawyer and I embezzled a few million.'' 
 
 `` For charities?'' 
 
 `` To buy a bigger boat than my boss.'' 
 
 The figure shook its nightmare-inducing head, making a tutting noise. `` Shameful.'' Its face brightened somewhat, if that can happen with a mouthful of razor sharp fangs. `` I do, however, know just who to pair you with!'' 
 
 Pair me with? Before I could ask, however, the figure raised its scaly fingers and somehow managed to snap them without taking off any digits. 
 
 There was a clink at my feet. A long iron chain had appeared, clamped onto my ankle and trailing off into the darkness. 
 
 I glanced up at the devil. `` Go on, follow it,'' the creature encouraged me. 
 
 Well, what could I do? I set off after the chain, trying to gather up the length in my arms as I followed it back towards its source. 
 
 The other end, I discovered several caverns later, turned out to be attached to a large, blue-collar angry worker by the name of Charlie. He was probably six inches and fifty pounds heavier than me, and he had the beefy arms and body of a dock worker. 
 
 `` Er, hi,'' I greeted him, once it was clear that our legs were attached by chain. `` I'm David, and I guess we're linked together or something.'' 
 
 The man nodded, not looking especially enthusiastic about this. `` Hi,'' he returned. `` So what are you in for?'' 
 
 `` Embezzlement. You?'' 
 
 The man shrugged. `` A guy ripped me off, so I killed him,'' he confessed without much concern. `` Ran him off the road. Unfortunately, I did n't really think about what would happen to me after, so I went down with him. Woke up here.'' 
 
 I nodded, wondering if I should be showing some sort of commiseration. `` Small world, actually,'' I said, more to fill the silence than any other reason. `` I actually died from some asshole running into me with his car. We tumbled right off the edge.'' 
 
 `` Really? The guy I killed, he was an embezzler!'' Charlie said, looking a little interested. `` Some nose in the air lawyer, totally ripped off my company so he could buy himself a boat or some shit.'' 
 
 It took another minute for realization to dawn, but it clicked for both of us. `` You!'' I gasped out in shock and anger, glaring at the man. 
 
 `` You!'' he returned, and I saw his big, meaty hands starting to tighten into fists. 
 
 For the next indeterminate period of time, there was a lot of fighting. 
 
 It turns out that in Hell, there are a lot of weapons sitting around! And some of them really do n't seem to fit in. I mean, I can understand why a devil would need a pitchfork ( presumably for prodding at sinners, I feel ), but I'm still not certain who decided that it was a good idea to leave a fully loaded stack of assault rifles over behind a stalagmite. 
 
 However, as the battle against Charlie waged on, it finally started to sink in to me that I was n't doing any actual damage. Sure, we were batting each other around a lot, and it was great to see his body shudder from getting hit with bullets, but there was no wounding, no killing going on. And as soon as I stopped shooting, Charlie popped right back up to come lunging at me with a battleaxe he'd found somewhere. 
 
 So once I ran out of bullets, I let the gun drop from my hands, and slipped down to take a seat on the cavern floor. Charlie, still red-faced and puffing, took a few more swings at me with the axe, but he eventually gave up on the futile effort. He dropped the weapon to the ground with a clatter and sagged down beside me. 
 
 `` Well, I feel a bit better,'' he commented at length, as we gazed out. There was n't much of a view, but it was at least better than running around grabbing weapons. 
 
 `` Yeah, me too.'' I looked at the man, noting that he did look much calmer. `` Good shot with that axe, though. You ever play any ball?'' 
 
 `` Minor league, yeah,'' he responded, looking surprised that I'd caught the shape of his stance. `` Busted my knee up, though, so I could n't go pro. I was n't that good anyway, to tell the truth.'' 
 
 `` Looked like you kept the form, at least,'' I offered. I received a nod of thanks for the compliment. 
 
 For a few more minutes, we sat there. `` So, now what?'' Charlie finally asked. `` Are n't we supposed to be getting tortured, or something?'' 
 
 I looked around. The other man was right - there was definitely a noticeable absence of grinning demons with pitchforks, or pools of boiling lava filled with screaming souls. `` Maybe it will start at some point,'' I guessed. `` I mean, I feel pretty bad about what I did, that's for certain.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, me too,'' Charlie agreed, although he did n't meet my eye. 
 
 I thought about just lapsing back into silence, but there was still a chain around our legs, connecting us, and I really did feel bad. `` Hey, man, look,'' I said, getting the other fellow's attention. `` I really am sorry about the whole embezzlement thing. I did n't ever stop to think about who I'd be hurting.'' 
 
 For a second, Charlie glared angrily at me, but he could n't keep it up, and the angry expression dropped. `` Aw, hell,'' he finally said. `` I'm sorry, too. I was just so angry that I decided I had to kill the sunovabitch - no offense,'' he added. 
 
 `` None taken.'' 
 
 `` But now, I mean, I could probably have gotten the money back, and I still had a good business and all that. It was n't like you really took anything from me I could n't get back.'' Charlie grimaced, but then his face cleared. `` And I'm sorry too.'' 
 
 I held out my smaller, office worker hand, and Charlie shook it with his big meaty mitt. 
 
 Feeling much better about ourselves, we sat on the ground of the cavern a bit longer. But then, as I glanced up and stretched, I noticed something I'd missed before. 
 
 `` Hey Charlie, look over there!'' 
 
 `` What's that?'' 
 
 I shrugged. `` It looks like a door,'' I said, climbing up to my feet to go approach it. But after a few steps, I noticed a jerk at my leg. I glanced down, and saw that the chain attaching our legs had grown noticeably shorter. `` Dude, come on. Let's go see it.'' 
 
 Charlie looked less than thrilled at having to get up, but he climbed to his feet and we ambled over. The door looked like a typical wooden interior door, but set into the wall of the cavern. I reached out for the handle, but paused, glancing at the man I'd been forcibly assigned. 
 
 `` We could always just stay here,'' I said, checking with him. 
 
 Charlie shook his head. When he glanced back at me, I was emboldened to see that there was no more anger in those eyes, just determination. `` Nah, let's see what's next.'' 
 
 So I opened the door, and we stepped through.

251383,"[ WP ] The Curiosity Rover finds the remains of an old viking longboat on Mars
","It was just an odd oblong hump, really, a pile that looked almost like a burial mound in the photos, but big. With results from chemical analysis, people hypothesized ancient trees preserved underground and a chance meteor strike dislodging and depositing the material on the surface. 
 
 After the third manned Martian expedition visited the site and delved into the mound, they discovered the artifacts, including the three corpses now known as Larry, Shemp, and Curly, all human. 
 
 ( Though I'll never understand why someone without hair was known as'Curly.' I suppose it is a form of humor. ) 
 
 After the furor of this discovery, archeologists and anthropologists finally arrived with the ninth expedition, whereupon they found the fine metal mesh in the long bones of the corpses. This was, of course, humanity's first recorded encounter with alien technology, the Bonescreen. 
 
 Further examination of the site on Mars never yielded any clear ideas how the longboat or the corpses got to Mars, although it did revolutionize our understandings of ancient Viking dentistry and anatomy. The so-called `` savage'' Vikings apparently were far more advanced than we realized ( though of course, there is no way they could have sailed a longboat to Mars ). 
 
 As scientists prised out the secrets of the Bonescreen and its uses, humanity began the long Golden Age of the 23rd Century. Not until the recent disaster of 2483 did we begin to suspect there were applications other than regeneration and immortality inherent in the alien technology. 
 
 While on a routine mining expedition in the asteroid belt, a miner in a shelter near the surface was struck by micrometeoroids, losing most of an arm. Later, as medics began the regeneration process, his Bonescreen reacted anomalously. 
 
 From examination of the debris and spectroscopic data, we know that much of the matter within several kilometers of the habitat vaporized due to a sudden and extreme rise in temperature. We believe the miner and his medics inadvertently triggered another operational regime of the Bonescreen: that of extracting zero-point energy. 
 
 It's also possible that the Bonescreen extracts energy from another manifold, but regardless, the disaster gave us the first efficient source of truly clean energy humanity has ever known. As a result, we envision a future where humankind not only will never again lack for energy, but perhaps each individual human will no longer extract energy by chemical or electrical means, instead using the energy of the Universe itself. 
 
 This raises interesting questions for cosmic exploration. With unlimited energy comes the practical ability to expand and stabilize atomic-sized wormholes, opening them to other parts of the Galaxy, perhaps even to other times. 
 
 That is the current project of the Mars Institute: to open a wormhole in our Viking Memorial Test Facility, near the site of the original discovery. 
 
 Yes, we have invested much preparation and in fact already performed a few test calibrations: opening small wormholes for short periods of time. It is perfectly safe; we calculated the openings to ensure that the wormholes do not open to the hearts of stars, or other times; or if they do go to other times, they are distant enough, and the wormhole opening short and small enough, there can be no disruption to causality. 
 
 Yes, we were distressed by the abrupt disappearance of three of our postgraduate students, but we understand that people who have n't even finished their first century of life do occasionally drop everything and strike out for greener pastures. Losing them does n't present a problem for the project. 
 
 Why yes, one of the students who disappeared was bald; why do you ask?

 `` Sorry about that buddy, you wan na give it another....'' And with that Jim trailed off. He could see a stone cold apprehensive look on Mike's face. They locked eyes and did n't say a word for several seconds before Jim took a deep breath. 
 
 `` Mike.......were we on vox?'' Jim asked fearfully. 
 
 Mike swallowed hard and nodded rapidly. 
 
 `` Oh no.....'' Jim said, placing his hands over his mouth. 
 Vox was a radio setting that allowed either pilot or co-pilot to speak and both patterns would be merged and transmitted. Everything he had just exclaimed was now making the 14 minute journey to earth. 
 
 Just then the radio keyed up but no words were transmitted through. Just a faint sound growing louder. It was...... it was...... laughing?? Jim thought. The roar in his ear piece grew so loud he had to turn the radio down. It was the Service Module pilot in orbit over Mars. He had just completed an orbit in time to pick up the outbound communication for earth. He had no doubt turned his broadcast to local and was free to laugh himself silly.

66448,"[ EU ] Metropolis has never heard of Superman . Miles away in the little town of Smallville , KS , Clark Kent is known as the greatest farmer to ever exist .
","*The Farmer of Steel 
 by Lois Lane* 
 
 SMALLVILLE, KA - Some are calling him the Lex Luthor of agriculture. Others are calling him a super farmer, capable of irrigating large swaths of crops in a single bound. To his hometown of Smallville, he is more powerful than a locomotive. He is a super man. 
 
 Clark Kent, 22, is Kansas' proudest farmer. Owner of Kent Farms, a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises, Clark Kent is an agricultural giant. His farm, which produces several hundred types of crops and livestock, is known for shipping incredible amounts of food every day. Even more impressively, the farm is stunningly clean. Agriculture, which has a considerable impact on the environment, has come under fire recently from environmental parties. Said Dr. Pamela Isely of Gotham City, `` The mass production of plants has left swaths of earth bare, never to produce again. Kent's methods are impressive in that his carbon footprint is nearly zero. Kent Farms is a model of what other farms should be.'' 
 
 Smallville certainly agrees. Only two decades ago, the town of only a few hundred people was devastated by a meteor shower, which polluted the soil and water of the town. Kent Farms has revitalized Smallville completely. A large portion of its economy owes itself to Kent Farms, which turned the sparsely-populated town into the farming capital of the United States. While Smallville will always be the meteor capital of the world, it is home to so much more. 
 
 The always humble Clark Kent has retained residence in the town all his life. After the passing of Johnathan Kent and the retirement of Martha Kent, Clark Kent single-handedly runs Kent Farms. He lives with wife Lana Kent in a quaint, ranch-style home and their dog, Krypto. While Kent certainly has a lot to be proud of, he is a humble man. The income the farm makes is incredible, yet he insists on remaining the same, small-town farmer he grew up as. A vast majority of the income he earns is donated to various foundations across the world. `` I do n't stand for money,'' Kent said in an interview last year. `` I stand for truth, justice, and the American way.'' 
 
 The methods Kent uses are kept closely under guard. His massive farm is protected by massive electric gates produced by Wayne Enterprises, preventing entry. This reporter earned an exclusive interview with Clark Kent. `` I have hundreds of thousands of acres of food, all of which is produced naturally and humanely,'' Kent said in his house. A large sea of corn and wheat could be seen from the window behind him. Cut into it was the Kent Farm logo. This'S' symbol inside a triangle is one of the most recognizable logos in the US today. 
 
 Mystery surrounds the'S' symbol, as Kent has never stated what the'S' stands for. `` When people see our logo, they do n't think of some word that begins with'S.' Some name. When people see our symbol, they think of hope,'' he said when asked. Many believe that the'S' stands for Smallville, though others believe it stands for something that was of sentimental value to the farmer. 
 
 After our interview, we toured his farm. In the center of the farm is a glass dome. Nominally a greenhouse, this dome surrounds a crater that was left during the Smallville Meteor Shower. `` I come here to think, to relax, and to enjoy life,'' said Clark Kent as he pointed around the dome. `` Some of my greatest secrets are in this dome, so I have to protect it. This glass is harder than steel. It's more of a fortress than a greenhouse. A fortress of solitude, if you will.'' The secretive farmer moved the interview out of the greenhouse when asked what a strange object on his desk was. 
 
 Kent is n't just a farmer. He's a local hero. Tales of him pulling cars out of ditches or rescuing people from fires are legion in Smallville. Most notably, he is believed to be responsible for putting out a brush fire in the town. With what equipment, he will not say. Many believed to have seen a flying object near the fire, though Kent has passed it off as some kind of bird or a plane. 
 
 Not all is happy in Smallville, unfortunately. LexCorp, a major competitor of Wayne Enterprises, is in a real-estate war with Kent Farms. LexCorp has recently come under scrutiny over agricultural practices used by the megacorporation, which has its hands in just about everything. Said Lex Luthor, `` I would n't believe everything Clark Kent has said. Nobody can run a farm like that naturally. Kent Farms is as guilty as any other mega-farm. They're just better at covering it up.'' 
 
 To wrap up the interview, this reporter asked Clark Kent what other passions he had. `` Journalism, actually,'' he responded with a chuckle. `` I was inches away from pursuing a degree in Journalism. Actually thought about taking an internship at the Daily Planet. Spreading the truth in print is one of the most noble things one can do, and I applaud the Daily Planet for their fair writing.''

Of course Mom never had the body to do them justice, her figure was probably better suited for the school sack race. Actually For awhile I thought that would be the last of my mental revisions of those clothes, until one day as I laid board at my desk reading the daily NASDAQ trends I abruptly heard the telephone ring. 
 
 `` It time, you've been chosen. It's been 37 years but you're finally ready.'' As soon as I heard those words I realized what had happened. I rapidly threw all my clean creased stationary off the desk, disconnected the Ethernet port and finally forwarded all those annoying chain letters I promised myself I would n't. I mean it was n't like I would need any of that where I was heading or for what I was going to be doing. I was about to finally live my dream. The trip took about 3 years but when I finally arrived to my new job.... 
 
 
 `` FABULOUS'' I uttered this as soon as the green scaled beauty strutted down the runway. It was honestly on honor to be chosen to do such a prestigious job. Not only was it rare for a human to be selected as a judge on `` The Galaxy's Next Top Model'', it was even rarer to be scouted as such since the youthful age of eight.

To think I was finally doing my dream job after all these years. Rating some of the best looking women in the universe. Come to think of it I never did realize why my mom wore the body of a deceased alien during the late hours of the night, but all of that did n't matter because I finally ended up what I wanted to be, an intergalactic fashionista.

52264,"Four brother princes vie for the right to rule . One commands the hearts of men , one has power over demons , one enslaves the dead , and one can control himself [ WP ]
","As Maurer lay upon his deathbed, he looked down from his raised vantage point at his four heirs gathered in a semicircle, three in their regal wargear, and the last, his youngest son, and most naive as he considered, wearing nothing but a pear of leather slacks with chainmail boots. The room was dim, with imposing artwork he'd collected through various campaigns, and his wife lying above him, or rather, her coffin as was tradition. 
 `` I've raised my children to the best of my ability, and as I look on you now I see nothing but lust and greed. It would be my wish the crown could be split four ways, The ruby, indicating the hearts of men, being dedicated to Logan with his rule to the North. The emerald, indicating power of demons, being dedicated to Graham with his rule to the east. The diamond, indicating power of those long passed, being dedicated to David in his rule to the west. And, leaving those three reserved, the frame, set him steel, being dedicated to my youngest, Eldin, who is yet the most bland of you four, and yet holds up his part in the quadrants. However, knowing you as I do, looking into your lustful eyes, I can see this is unlikely to happen, and wish for there to only be no bloodshed, and I leave this to you, Logan, as my eldest, to carry out as my dying wish. I have already instructed for there to be three new, and equal to my already standing general, commanders in my legions each dedicated to obeying the wishes of a prince.'' 
 
 With this, Maurer, High King of Verona, Leader of Dane, Conqueror of the West, and son of Bentley the Brave, passed out of this earth. 
 
 The four brothers stood in their circle, the tension visibly mounting in the room as the demons under Graham's control edged ever closer with a mounting temper. The caskets that encircles the burial chamber were already open, with dead standing at attention facing David as he mounted his warhorse. Logan had already placed gold outside the doorway, using his control, or rather his understanding of men's greed to ensure the legion under his control was ready and waiting when he needed them. Meanwhile, Eldin simply continued to stand in the common legion posture, knees bent slightly, calves tensed, head forward staring straight out at the horizon. 
 
 `` To honor my father's wishes, I hereby order you all to leave this room in an effort to avoid bloodshed. I, as eldest, son of Maurer, christened Logan of Verona, assert my right to the throne.'' Logan declared in his well-rehearsed and deepest voice, as he swelled his twenty-two year old chest, attempting to look as big as possible in front of the men standing at attention outside the door. 
 
 David and Graham looked at each other for but a moment, nodded subtly in such a way it would seem as contact never passed, turned, and walked out of the room signaling their legions from the balcony to make ready to march. Eldin broke his Legion stance and watched his brothers go, then proceeded to turn as if to leave. 
 
 `` Brother, wait.'' Eldin started, the voice surprising him with its power, however he soon had control of his emotions, and turned to face his brother. 
 
 `` I have nothing more for me here, I have long meditated, and already know what must be done. It is something that has become clear to me, and only I can fulfill this. I see treachery everywhere, a throne upstarted, two brothers in a temporary alliance preparing for war against your legions and mine, only to then turn on each other. I see the peasants packing their carts in the street, seeing the flags of war being raised. I see children running to the outer rivers of the town as the water supplies are being salted to avoid stalemates. This kingdom is at war, and if only I can control my lust, and further my greed, then I must take my legion and protect the innocent and young.'' 
 
 Logan, unfazed, put all his cunning into his next words; `` Brother, I merely mean to suggest we for an alliance to deter our less faithful brothers. It is my throne, join me and I shall appoint you second in command of the kingdom. If saving the peasantry truly is your goal, then join allegiance with me.'' 
 
 `` Alas brother, I see the evil and treachery in your eyes. Controlling the hearts of men is easy if the men are lustful, greedy, and think of not but themselves. Alas, I am not so easily persuaded.'' With that, he marched to his newly appointed chief of staff, and began issuing orders. Logan turned, disgusted, and began preparing the castle for war. 
 
 David and Graham and moved their legions to the outskirts of the capitol, and were raising as many dead and demonic entities as they could to assist their human soldiers. The fields were stamped down, farmers hid in their huts as legions of horrors passed them, followed by the royal militia. Weeks of food was stolen, water supplies were emptied as the larger and larger army kept moving towards the capitol hill. They were beginning the road of war, in which they would pillage as much of the countryside as possible while picking up food and supplies plus as many a man as was fit for soldiering. They would eventually make it into a few neighboring cities before finally coming back to the capitol in order to take the throne. 
 
 Eldin rode ahead, doing his best to round up farmers and move them out of harm's way before his brothers arrived. He picked apples, harvested grain, and worked with his men as they moved food and supplies to safe depots. They moved quickly, and made it to the first large city before David's army, which was a day's march behind. 
 
 David and Graham, however, were not entirely happy with their prospective campaign being lost due to an unsuspected betrayal from their youngest sibling. They contrived to move their legions in a pincer movement on a town three days march on their current route; however by cutting through and missing a small village they would be able to make it in two, enough time to meet Eldin right as he arrived. 
 
 Eldin, not knowing of the diabolical plot also cut a corner, thinking that small village would not be worth his time, and instead delegated a small contingent to instead move away from his main legion to aid the small encampment. He, knowing there was only one stop left on the campaign trail before reaching the capitol, then proceeded to tell his Legion while also himself moving back to the capitol with nothing but a small guard. 
 
 The final stop, Torres, was in a state of war. A peasant had come into town speaking of horrors on the way from abroad, legions of skeletons, royal soldiers, and demonic beats straight from the pits of hell. This compounded with the rest of Eldin's legion was enough to solidify the town into a fortress overnight, all in preparation for the inevitable battle. 
 
 David mounted the crest to the west of Torres, and Graham came out of the valley to the East. The town of Torres lay in the center of a wide open plain, sparkling in the noonday sun, with the villagers frantically finishing their sandbag barriers while the last of the cattle were headed inside the walls. David and Graham knew their armies were more than enough for the small encampment, but still tactically divided their troops in half and approached from every cardinal direction, and mounted the walls. The slaughter knew no end, every man, woman, and child was slaughtered. There was no mercy for those inside Torres, the cattle were dismembered by the hoards of Demonic beings, and the dead claimed everything that moved as their own. 
 
 Meanwhile, scouts on Logan's behalf had reported the size of the new army that had been amassed. Logan was worried to be sure, but he had done some recruiting of of his own. He had summoned every able-bodied man in the kingdom, promising safety in the enrollment of his legions. There was naught a mortal army to compare with the size of his combined four legions. Logan prepared the Capitol for war. 
 
 David and Graham had finally amassed the mightiest hoard of beings ever seen in the kingdoms, and slowly they progressed upon the Capitol. It was a day's march, they made it in a day and a half, being slowed by the size of their hoard. As they closed in on the city gates, Logan hailed them from the royal balcony, waving a flag of parlay. 
 `` My brothers, let use have one last chance. Be there no bloodshed today, lest we deny out father's final wish.'' 
 
 But his cries, his power was useless on the raw lust that lay in his siblings. With a great cry, the armies of the undead mounted the walls, and the legionnaires valiantly fought from the inside. The fighting lasted for hours, hacked limbs, grass so red it appeared to be a sea of blood. David and Graham lead from the back, forcing their armies on while they summoned more hoards. Logan was slowly backed into the castle, leaving the peasants unable to fight to be slaughtered. He was then backed into the throne room, where naught but a hundred men were left under his aide. Then, the last of them were hacked into nothingness. With great relish, a giant demonic monster of red and gold smashed in Logan's skull and he was no more. 
 
 David and Graham heard the victory cries of the demon, and stabbed each other in tandem, each as surprised by the treachery as the other. Their legions sank into the ground as no more commands forthcame, and the battlefield was quiet. 
 
 Eldin, with his small guard, mounted the crest to Capitol hill two days later, having been delayed by some roadside bandits. All that was left was a smoking mound of rubble, for the battle had left nothing. Their powers were too much, they had destroyed each other, there was nothing left to rule. Saddened, Eldin turned away with his guard to find what was left.

 `` Okay, now that we're taking care of that, onto the harder part - who's going to chat with GM and Ford?'' Branton asked the aide. 
 
 `` I think it might be prudent of you to call them yourself, sir. If anyone important is still awake, that is.'' 
 
 Branton sighed. `` Fuck, you're right. What time is it?'' 
 
 `` Three seventeen AM. The relevant location, Detroit, has local time two seventeen AM,'' the desk computer said crisply. 
 
 `` Three seventeen in the fucking morning! After a Friday, no less! Why could n't she have downloaded the goddamn car on a Tuesday afternoon, when we'd have plenty of time to deal with it?''

 `` They really went and downloaded a fucking car, huh?'' Branton said again, in disbelief. 
 
 `` New reports indicate that it's a 2026 model year Mustang,'' the aide supplied. `` Electric Blue. She knew that it'd make a big splash, so she did it in a big way.'' 
 
 `` I should have seen this coming. Ever since Google went around last year installing those house-sized 3D printers as utilities in Bumfuck, Kansas - it's just like the 2017 Fiber piracy fiasco all over again.'' 
 
 `` Was that really a fiasco, sir?'' 
 
 `` If it was n't, then why are we sitting here?'' 
 
 `` Because the Cabinet needed a new villain after Homeland Security got dissolved?'' 
 
 `` Very funny. The public still hates Education and VA more than me,'' Branton said. 
 
 `` Will they, sir? After this? When you're the one stopping them from downloading cars?'' 
 
 `` Fuck, I do n't know. Frankly, I do n't care. I just want to download some liquor and go home,'' Branton said sarcastically. 
 
 `` Liquor downloading,'' said the desk. 
 
 `` Wait, what? That's a thing? Stop! I was joking!'' Branton yelled, pawing at the monitor. 
 
 `` Illicit downloading of consumables detected. This machine has been shut down by the DCE.'' 
 
 `` Fuck you! You're the computer running that shutdown program, you little silicon-based shit! You've just.... oh, *fuck*,'' Branton said, as a wave of realization slammed into him. And all across the nation, a revolution occurred. 
 
 `` AP has already published its story, and local news sites around the country are picking it up,'' the Aide said, swiping the image from her Glass to the Secretary's. The words `` YOU WOULD DOWNLOAD A CAR'' appeared, ghostly tormentors, in front of his eyes.

","It is a strange thing to appear. I was once a floating spec in a different world, drifting through hundreds of voices chanting, `` I wish for... I wish for...'' Then suddenly, `` POOF''. Here I am. 
 
 I did not know what kind of wish I would become. The usual wish would transform into a million dollars, or the resurrection of a loved one. I am neither of those. I tilt my head down to examine my naked body and quickly notice that I am a woman. A remarkable woman, at that. My legs are hairless and glistening with a natural tanned glow. My hips curve deliciously into my petite waist. My breasts are round and set high on my chest, with perky, pink nipples delicately protruding.

139136,"[ WP ] Aliens invade Earth but not with force of arms and great numbers . Instead they release a highly contagious virus that modifies a human 's body into that of an alien . You 're one of the few immune people .
","Earth used to be such a great place for me. I had a job, some decent friends, cozy little apartment, but now- I could hardly recognize it. It had been a month since the Assimilation began, and so much had changed. Most obviously were the people, if you could call them that anymore. The Assimilation was so powerful because it turned those it was trying to overtake into their own, shifting the form and mind to that of their own kind. I first noticed this when my roommate began to grow scales, his body growing larger and more animalistic day by day. He moved out after he became one of those lizard things, said he had been given `` his life purpose''. 
 
 As far as I can piece together, this life purpose thing was a job each of the assimilated had to take up, an unending craving to serve pushed them to work in the exact role they had been given. All in all, we were becoming the most dedicated work force in the galaxy. You see, the aliens currently assimilating all of us were not the lizard things we were becoming. They were a more refined race, where the lizards are an engineered race of workers. You've just got to love being made to serve. 
 
 Today, about 60 % of humanity is now assimilated, politicians swearing themselves to the Vendars Empire and preparing mass assimilations. That was another part of this whole situation that sucked for our odds, the Assimilation was a virus. You could catch it like the flu, and that meant this thing traveled fast. One member of a household or workplace could change, then instantly be directed to change all others around them. It was practically the perfect plan. 
 
 Now, I did say practically for a reason. As with every virus, there are some who simply are immune. As you probably guessed, I'm one of those lucky individuals. A part of me wishes I'd just start growing scales and obeying a prime directive, just to get everything over with. I've just been sitting around, waiting for something to happen as my world and race die off. Just a total fun fest all around for me. 
 
 Today, every screen I could see turned a pale blue. This was something that had grown very familiar to me, the very same phenomenon was what marked the beginning of the Assimilation. Sure enough, a few moments after I started to watch the screen a voice began to speak. 
 
 `` Attention all indigenous lifeforms. By our accounts, a good majority of remaining indigenous high intelligence lifeforms are immune to our treatments. We must congratulate you, for your genetics have surpassed all others on this planet. As of such, you shall be gifted your own new roles. Please watch the screen as your role is given.'' 
 
 Before I had time to even question the broadcast, the screen flickered with strange symbols. Almost instantly, my eyes were glued to the screen, much to my dismay. I tried to walk away, to shut my eyes, to do anything to pry myself from where I was- but it was no use. This was it, I was done for. 
 
 Drool began to stream from the side of my mouth, my mind going blank as I stared at the screen. At first, the symbols were all just gibberish, but the more I watched, the more they made sense, they were letters. The letters were spelling out my directive, my direct order from the Emperor. I was to be an overseer of this mining colony, to command all Thrulls on this planet to serve the empire. 
 
 Deep in my mind, I wanted to fight this, but the overwhelming power of the broadcast had me completely enveloped. Memories and desires faded, as I became a tool of the empire. My last thoughts before completely fading into subservience, was wondering what came next... 
 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 
 I stepped from the pod, my fellows applauding loudly as I did. My form was now far more befitting of my status as overseer. My strange human form was cast away, as the form of the Vendars people took its place. My pale blue skin shimmered under the light, as the words of my emperor played back in my mind. `` You were the best of your dead race, see if you can be the best of ours.'' The weak had succumbed to our gift, where the strong were lifted above the rest. All was good in the world, my world, Vendars VIII.

 Suddenly it stops, and I am at peace. Teleported to a grassy paradise where Angels dance and sing. I race through the fields, feeling life itself brush against my skin until suddenly I am in a hell. Fire surrounds me, scalding my skin. I turn red like a peach, and burst into a juicy mass. 
 
 I am recollected, lying down on a cloud above New York City, watching humanity go by. I re-position myself, rolling over so that I stare downwards. And I leap. Fall straight into the Empire State Building, head first, skull crumbling inwards at lightning velocity. Yet I survive, my skull rebuilding itself in a fraction of an instant. 
 
 I am conducting a symphony orchestra in Vienna. Demons fill the audience, and I play their music. It is sweet and seductive, with an evil tint. I am enraptured by my own creation. Or at least I am enraptured, until I turn and see I am not its creator. Blind eunuchs play the instruments, deaf to their own magical abilities. I am useless. 
 
 And I am God. I am Zeus, holding the lightning bolt. I am the burning bush. I am destruction. I return to New York City, and I blow it up in a smoldering cascade of the hellfire I ran through previously.

183947,"[ WP ] In a world of wands and wizardry , you are a legendary assassin , killing your targets without them even realizing it . Your secret ? Guns , a whole armory of them .
","With a whisper, I appeared at a summit overlooking a small town. Below, two roads forked out from the town and passed to the left and right of the hill where I stood. But I was safe here. Probably. 
 
 Most wizards do n't truly understand teleportation. You ca n't just suddenly move your entire body mass into one space and expect the air to simply disappear. It's got ta go somewhere, and that usually means a massive bang, bringing the Ministry to ban teleportation in populated areas. But I've figured it out. I simply teleport whilst teleporting the space I'm gon na occupy back into my place. In short, I switch places with the air, and travel with no one even noticing. Perfect. 
 
 I surveyed the area carefully. Everything was going according to plan. Skies clear, trees were n't so much as rustling, wind definitely was n't a problem. 
 
 Today's target was a high-ranking wizard from the Ministry, on an official visit to officially open the new town hall. And the ceremony was underway, right on schedule. 
 
 I lay down the silver briefcase and unlatch it. Usually I have the right gun for the job, but for such a public assassination, some... discretion would be wise. Inside lay a Russian-made beauty, the SVD. Ivan, my arms dealer friend in the non-wizarding world, had lent it to me just for this occasion. I would have preferred something with more oomph, like a Barrett. Shield charms tend to deflect anything below 7.62mm rounds, and I wanted that extra guarantee. But given that he's gon na be shaking hands with lots of folks, he probably wo n't be shielding up anyway. 
 
 I assembled my rifle, remembering to attach the suppressor this time. The bang was still huge, but wizards were always teleporting into the countryside anyway, so I was covered there. It was the flash I wanted to hide. Some shepherd saw it a few kills back, and decided he was a detective that day. My memory charms have been sharp ever since. 
 
 The band was playing, and the target was all smiles. If it was any comfort, I knew of his reputation, that he had to backstab a few of his comrades to be where he is today. But then again, everyone who's somebody in the Ministry had to step on a few heads to get to where they are. 
 
 I sat against the hillside and propped my rifle up using my arm. Stability charms worked wonders, and my aim was steady as a rock. 
 
 I had the target in my sights. I slowly exhaled, and leaned my finger into the trigger. 
 
 `` BANG!'' The shot echoed through the dry mountain air. 
 
 But in the distance, the target was still laughing and shaking hands. 
 
 I hastily peered through my scope again. I spied a bullet hole on the steps leading to the stage. 
 
 Silly me, I forgot to adjust for range. 
 
 I adjusted my sights and drew a bead on him. This time I would not miss. 
 
 `` BANG!'' 
 
 In the distant town, an indistinct figure collapsed onto the ground, and cheer gave way to panic. A quick peek through my scope confirmed that my bullet had met its mark. 
 
 A job well done. 
 
 I packed my rifle and disappeared with a teensy'zip' sound, wind whispering murder in my wake.

 `` Our fellow brothers were killed using this!'' He beckoned at the bit of lead in his hand, drawing the crowd to an uncontrollable clamor. It took a minute to settle everyone down. 
 
 `` My fellow Ministers! Brothers!'' He exclaimed, voice growing higher and higher. `` We must eradicate this evil that has befallen us! Whoever finds and kills this monster will be rewarded with a warlock's ransom! A hundred palms of gold to the one who kills the Wizard of Lead!''

 Stephen Hawking was now a puppet, a very expensive, remote controlled puppet. The spell in the hospital in 2009 had left him brain dead, the `` respiratory infection'' scare was just made up for the public to buy. And it worked, they were none the wiser. 
 
 For five years now the University of Cambridge has been Mr Hawking. Every public appearance has been controlled by one same man sitting at a computer, controlling his wheelchair remotely. He even had programmed in pauses in his speech to make it look like he was typing. Rather disturbingly, he also controlled his facial expressions through implants. In another corner was a woman taking a sip of her coffee, ghostwriting his next book. 
 
 Why did n't they just let him die? Well, i'll answer that question with another question; how many other physicists do the general public actually listen to? Between him and Brian Cox, there are n't many. Stephen has been capturing the public's imagination with Physics for decades now, and if it takes morally questionable methods to carry on then so be it. That was the University's stance, anyway. For the greater good. It's not like he felt pain anymore. 
 
 There was a knock on the door, his ex-wife Jane walked in. A collective greeting was heard from everyone in the room. 
 
 `` Stephen has a interview at 2pm.'' 
 
 `` We know, he'll be ready.''

 `` *Relax. * I'm just here to tell you that, as I said, the mission failed. I could n't get a decent read on his whereabouts. That being the case, I'm here to return the money.'' 
 
 I pulled the check out and handed it to him. 
 
 `` You're the best assassin that I could get, the one who was able to kill political figures, and you ca n't even track down a fucking kid?!'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, sir.'' 
 
 He turned away, and I made my move. Pistol out, shot him in the knee. He fell to the ground, and I stabbed him in the back. 
 
 As I grabbed the check, I looked to the corners of the room and shot the cameras. Then, I looked to the man at my feet, struggling to breathe. Must've punctured the lung. 
 
 Kneeling to the floor, I looked him dead in the eyes. I took off my hood and my mask, and said the words that made his face go absolutely pale, even paler than it was, with him losing blood. 
 
 `` Fuck you, dad.''

Something about mouth-to-mouth with the doll unnerved her, however, and she had n't done it in the week after she brought Anne home. 
 
 The day before the next class, however, she bit the bullet. She had to do it to get better. Sarah pressed her lips to the lips of the doll, and blew several breaths into it. The rubbery material of Anne's mouth felt like it was getting warmer under Sarah's breath. As Sarah brushed Anne's lips for the fifth time, a muffled gasp reached her ears. Suddenly, the whole doll convulsed under her. 
 
 `` Oh my god!'' Sarah cried, stumbling backwards. The doll took rapid, heaving breaths. It tried to crane its neck, its eyes darting furiously behind closed lids that could n't open. It screamed, and screamed, and screamed. When it finally fell quiet, a blank expression fell over its face. 
 
 `` Je suis où?'' it dully asked. `` Une vie après la mort?'' 
 
 Sarah did n't understand French. Even if she could, she did n't have the ability to respond. 
 
 [ `` La Seine. Je suis tombé dans la seine. Et maintenant...'' ] ( https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Inconnue_de_la_Seine ) The doll wiggled the edges of its torso, trying to move limbs that were n't there. It began to sob. No tears came from the edges of its rubber eyes. 
 
 As Sarah regained some semblance of control of her body, she stood quietly and walked gingerly past the dummy to her door. Reaching it, she yanked it open and dashed out, slamming it behind her. She raced out of the door, hyperventilating until she collapsed, lightheaded, on the sidewalk. Unable to get a grasp of her breathing, Sarah's world turned to black. 
 
 There was a brush of warm against Sarah's lips. She gasped as she woke, her eyes trying to flutter open. 
 
 They could n't. 
 
 Sarah screamed.

","I took a deep breath and looked into the flickering, whirling mass in front of me. 
 
 `` Ladies, Gentleman and all other Genders, welcome to another episode of *'When in the World?'* We have another competitor lined up and almost ready to travel! Competitor, are you.. ready-to-go?'' the presenter asked me, annoyingly chirpy. `` The time to beat is 15 days, 9 hours and 4 minutes, will you make it?''. 
 
 `` I'm ready'' I flexed my shoulders and stepped forward. 
 
 spinning, burning, ow ow owowowowo OW..... **zap** 
 
 I landed naked as a jaybird, out of breath and sick as a dog. It took me a full minute to get my balance back and really look at my surroundings. 
 
 Soft furniture. It all looked... weird though. Like a designed thought bright colours and weird shapes made up for a complete lack of talent. The house was huge and open plan, so I walked around. Outside of this lounge area was a small walled garden with a pool and a Jacuzzi. I still was n't sure where I was. There was a big kitchen and I found a communal sleeping area. 
 
 What the hell was going on? 
 
 Suddenly a voice came over loudspeakers that appeared to be hidden all around the house, blaring out with a Newcastle accent. `` Contestant, you have entered the house early, please wait in the lounge area to greet the other contestants. Welcome... to the big brother house.'' 
 
 Oh god. oh god oh god. Early 21st century television. They had watched hours and *hours* of insipid idiots doing mind numbingly boring things. I could n't live through this. My 26th century sensibilities were n't ready for this. Death maybe, boredom.... god no. 
 
 I ran through the kitchen to where I had seen a door up some stairs. It must've been the door out. If I could get out of here, I knew I just needed to head due north for 2 miles to reach a beam out `` I quit'' spot. I tried it. Locked. Damn. 
 
 The annoying Newcastle accented voice came back `` Contestant, please step back from the door. Now you have entered, you will not be aloud to leave for the minimum 14 days. Please welcome your new flatmate, Carol'' 
 
 The door suddenly unlocked in my hands. The door opened to a lift, in which stood a short fat woman in glasses. 
 
 `` Hi, I'm Carol'' she said. Peering inside the lift was sealed, with no buttons. No exit there. I stood aside holding the door for her. Carol walked up to me `` Oh my god how dare you use your white male priveledge on me, I am a modern feminist woman you ca n't possibly think its ok to hold the door for me and''... she droned on and on. Oh god. Why could n't I have gotten the Roman coliseum like that last guy. He'd just been stabbed to death, nice and quickly. ``... And how dare you stand there completely nude in front of me like that, fat shaming me with your perfect abs...'' she carried on, so I just walked away.

 Day 3, and 13 contestants later, they were all as bad. They had outdone themselves with `` interesting'' contestants this year. They had titled me *The naked dude* and I was considered one of the least extreme of the contestants. There was the dude who was convinced he was actually a horse, one guy who I was pretty sure was just schizophrenic, a quadriplegic girl who was actually rather lovely but could n't really do any of the challenges, and the neo-nazi who had so far gotten into a fist fight with the social-justice-warrior and two of the black guys. I just had to escape. the garden wall was quite unclimable, but I thought if I re-arranged the stupid furnature I might make it to the top and be free. I could n't stand the thought of staying another day. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 
 Day 4. The garden wall failed me, they had anti-escape nets that caught me as soon as I got to the top, and I saw a secondary compound surrounding the house. I needed some way out. Yesterday I had tried. Faking an illness and claiming I needed medical attentions, but they just dropped basic medical supplies into the house and made healing me a `` Surprise challenge''. It was amazing how fast the weightlifting asain guy got across the house to get his big hands on *The naked guy*. I quickly *got better*. 
 
 Today I tried digging my way out. I dug about 7 feet before I met a wire mesh, sealing us into the enclave. I just... I ca n't take any more. Today the challenge was to pass eggs mouth-to-mouth from one end of the garden and back again. I think the producers were looking to incite some romance, but it just made me vomit having a slobbered on egg spewed into my mouth by the punk-rock chick who never washes. I think I'll need a rabies jab if I survive this.

 Day 5. I just. I do n't think I'll be able to take this any longer. I know there are only two ways out of here, and one is the beam out. The other is death. I think... Maybe tomorrow.

 Day 6: I took a knife from the kitchen, intending to slit my wrists, but moment I was alone in the bathroom I chickened out. I just... I just ca n't do pain. The challenge today was n't so bad, we had to break into teams and juggle the largest objects we could find in our groups. My team won, juggling watermelons, as the group trying to juggle chairs dropped theirs. We got fed today and they did n't. I just want to be free.

 Day 22: The moment I was alone with the knife four heavies broke in an took it from me. The producer followed them in and told me that whilst a death would be brilliant for ratings, I was too popular to let go this early. Please. Just.... I ca n't do it any more.

 The schizophreniac was delicious. 
 
 The Nazi killed the other black guy, Tom, so its just me, the nazi and the quiet girl. Sucks to be her, she's gotten through by being ignore so far and as they suspended all evictions, she wont last long. Hehehe do n't matter to me though.

 Day 57: We've all taken different sections of the house. I have the kitchen, the quite-lass has the lounge and the Nazi holds the courtyard. We've entered a standoff. Armed and ready. If one of us moves, the other two will get them. But I'm ready. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 Day 58: AH HA HA HA HA. I made Molotovs from the booze in the kitchen and firebombed the lounge. It sent the quiet lass scurrying straight into the arms of the Nazi. I bet he ate her right up.

 Day 70: She held me off so long. I'm certainty not bored but I am done. No more. I surrender. I scraped together the ingredients I needed and made a bath bomb. No not a relaxing soak, but a nitro-glycerin fueled fun time. I go. She goes. The producers go. We all go. Goodbye.

","The Man In The Dark squirmed. 
 
 Not unlike the stirrings of infants in utero, or the twitching of some young bird as it prepares to crack open the eggshell walls that have been home up to this point, the Man In The Dark began to press out against the dirt that surrounded him. 
 
 As he moved more of the earth, his movements could be viewed perhaps more in the tradition of cicada shells, or the great constricting snakes that twist out of themselves and become something familiar but new, at once larger, and sleeker: 
 
 Simply put, the Man In The Dark was preparing to be born. 
 
 *Black. That's what this is. It's black. * 
 *I know this. I know color. I know things. I know what it is to know. * 
 *Where am I? Where have I come from? Why do n't I need to breathe? * 
 
 As he dug away from the dirt that fell, the Man In The Dark tried to make sense of things. He knew where gravity pulled at him, so he could recognize up from down. He knew that where he was there was nothing but Dirt. He knew Dirt. Intimately, now. 
 
 But most of all, before all other things that he knew that he simply should not exist. 
 
 On some basic, instinctual level, something about his existence was intrinsically wrong. He knew this. But there was nothing to do about it, but to climb. 
 And so he climbed. 
 
 When he cracked the Earth open and emerged at last from the Dirt, his hands trembled, his mouth was parched, cracked and caked dry with gravel and the sand of the Earth. Above him, there was the immense black slate of night, dotted with countless stars. Surrounding him, for miles and miles, was the desert. 
 
 At the foot of the crater of his birth, he saw only a single pale white stone, inscribed with seven words.

","I splashed water on my face and looked up at the mirror. What I thought had been water was some sort of orange liquid. It moved around my face before being absorbed into my skin. 
 
 `` Oh that's not good'' I said 
 
 Making a mental note to get that checked later, if I did n't blow up or turn into a space praying mantis or something, I adjusted my tie and left the bathroom. 
 
 … 
 
 I stood outside the door to my section, glad that they sectioned off council members by species, and not just for the normal reason of, they had done it because fights kept breaking out and every species on the council could break me like a twig. It was also because humans had not exactly endeared themselves to the council and I liked the idea of just being able to sneak in, not say anything an leave. 
 
 I exhaled and opened the door. 
 
 `` The human representative has entered'' said an electronic voice over a loud speaker as I sat down 
 
 `` Shit'' I said, as all speaking stopped and everyone turned to me. There was death in their stares. 
 
 Literally, some of them had laser eyes that were stopped by the energy shield surrounding my enclosure. 
 
 `` Uh, ahem, hi everyone'' I said, standing up and waving `` I'm the new guy, not sure if you knew. Ha-ha'' 
 
 They kept staring. 
 
 `` Those humans all look the same to us'' I said, affecting a hill billy accent. I do n't know why I did that. 
 
 They kept staring. 
 
 `` Any way I'm Tim…what the fuck'' I said as what looked like an arrow broke through the barrier 
 
 `` Hey, hey. We talked about this'' said the head of the council a big thin grey guy with a hat that I knew for a fact had been insulted by my predecessor. I could see why, but I also had a filter, which was why I got the job. 
 
 Well that and losing the coin toss. 
 
 `` The human started it'' growled an alien who's build, temperament and predominately bone clothing screamed warrior race 
 
 `` Did he?'' said the council head 
 
 `` Yeah, by being a dick'' 
 
 `` No see, but that was the last guy I'm Tim, the last guy was… well also Tim, but a different Tim. And between you and me, we all thought he was an asshole too. In fact we were a little bit happy when you found him…strung upside down in his quarters…drained of all blood…with his spine missing…and his head stuffed in his stomach cavity. But I am a different guy'' 
 
 The council had turned back to the warrior. 
 
 `` When we allowed you to bring in your ancestral weapons what was our agreement'' 
 
 `` That I would n't use them to shoot through the barriers'' 
 
 `` And what did you just do?'' 
 
 `` I shot through the barrier'' 
 
 It was like seeing a parent scold a child. I wanted to laugh but did n't because I did n't want that guy stringing his next bow with my vocal chords. Wait are vocal chords actually chords? 
 
 Part of my intestine maybe? I do n't know. 
 
 `` Now that we have that settled and all councillors have arrived-'' 
 
 `` Oh were you waiting on me?'' I said, interrupting the head of the council like an asshole 
 
 `` We can begin a civil discourse free of fighting, hostility and interruption'' he said, looking at me. 
 
 `` Sorry'' I said `` damn it'' 
 
 `` We also try to refrain from profanity'' 
 
 I opened my mouth to speak and then did n't. It may take me forever but I'll learn eventually. 
 
 I sat back down and put my briefcase beside the desk they had provided. A race started talking about how barricades by a different race was affecting their relationship with a third race. 
 
 Or something. 
 
 I was really just there because of the coin toss. 
 
 While drifting off I started opening drawers in the desk. I opened one and a snake like thing jumped out at me. 
 
 `` Oh fuck'' I said, standing up. It bit me on the cheek. I scream…yelled a manly battle cry and ripped it off my face and threw it at the barrier where it disintegrated with a scream. 
 
 `` Oh fuck, what the fuck was that'' I said 
 
 I felt something warm on my face. Turns out ripped was the right word because when the snake thing went so did a chunk of skin. 
 
 Aliens started laughing. 
 
 `` He touched it. The dumb motherfucker touched it'' said the warrior one 
 
 `` What the fuck was that'' 
 
 `` Swearing'' said the head of the council 
 
 `` That was my shit'' said the warrior 
 
 `` You shit snakes? Fuck you people are hard core'' 
 
 `` I am not a person'' roared the warrior as he stood up, causing me to jump back even though he was n't even remotely near me `` and what the fuck is a snake'' 
 
 `` Swearing'' said the head of the council 
 
 `` It's a…I touched shit. I touched your shit. It got on my face. I got your shit on my shitting face'' I think i meant fucking instead of shitting. Whatever, it was a high stress situation. 
 
 `` Swear…you know what, let's take a recess'' said the head of the council. 
 
 I was already out the door. 
 
 … 
 
 I splashed water on my face again, forgetting it was n't water. I stood up just in time to see the orange stuff absorb into my skin. 
 
 Behind me a toilet flushed and some sort of Lobster/Centaur thing came out, zipping up his multi legged pants. 
 
 `` Oh hey new guy'' he said 
 
 `` Hey'' I said, turning back to the mirror `` What the…'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` The chunk of missing skin is gone'' 
 
 `` What to try that again'' 
 
 `` My face is healed'' I said 
 
 `` Yeah, that orange stuff, do n't worry, it's harmless'' he said, answering my question just as I was making a stupid, puffed up I'm about to ask a question face `` it heals you'' 
 
 `` That's useful'' 
 
 `` Yeah, they put it in after council members kept injuring each other'' 
 
 `` I thought they separated everyone to stop that from happening'' 
 
 `` Well yeah, but once council breaks it can be a real free for all. Do n't worry though, just leave five minutes early. Worked for your predecessor'' 
 
 `` Uhm…'' 
 
 `` Well, for a while anyway'' 
 
 `` Yeah'' 
 
 `` And do n't worry. Everyone's first day is tough. I remember my first day'' 
 
 `` Was it this bad'' 
 
 `` I negotiated a peace treaty and laid the groundwork for my planet to become an economic power house'' he said 
 
 I turned to look at him. 
 
 `` Right sorry. But honestly, I feel like I'm just getting the hang of it now'' 
 
 `` How long have you been on the council?'' 
 
 `` Two hundred and fifty years'' 
 
 `` Well fuck'' 
 
 `` Hey, keep at it champ'' he said, and patted me on the butt as he left, like I was about to go take part in the…sport competition. 
 
 `` Sorry that how my species says goodbye'' he said, coming back 
 
 `` It's cool'' I said 
 
 `` Well, keep at it champ'' he said, smacking my butt again, causing me to jump forward. 
 
 I heard the door close behind him. I looked in the mirror and splashed more orange stuff on my face. I watched it absorb in and I felt slightly better. I hope that stuff is n't habit forming.

44116,"[ IP ] Tea Time
","`` This is my rock you are sitting on.'' The human with the steaming cup in his hands stared blankly at Dorian. 
 
 `` E-excuse me?'' The words came out soft, barely a whisper through lightly clenched teeth. If Dorian had not had ears the size that he did, he would not have heard him over the crack and sizzle of the sulfurous lava rivers flowing below them. 
 
 Dorian scratched at one of his bio-luminescent horns with his arrow shaped tail. `` My rock.'' He gestured around him with a pointed hoof, claiming the porous igneous mountain they were on. `` You are sitting on my rock. Why?'' 
 
 The young man, hiking pack resting behind him, blinked. The cup in his hands tilted forward, untended by his attention. Dorian wondered what was on this young thing's mind. Drops of hot liquid dripped onto his hands, scalding him. He righted the cup and shook off the offending drink, pushing the burnt finger into his mouth for relief. `` I was sightseeing,'' the young man finally answered through a mouthful of finger. 
 
 `` Ah,'' Dorian sighed, voice deep, even for a member of the Kadappa race, from years of sulfuric smoke inhalation, `` You are from another land.'' 
 
 `` A-another world.'' They young man's eyes bored holes in the ground. He shivered despite the heat. He grabbed the cap he was wearing and used it to wipe away the sweat beading on his forehead. `` I'm a traveler from Earth.'' 
 
 `` Earth.'' An almost imperceptible nod from the intruder. Dorian looked to his right, gazing at the sheer cliff sides of the great mountain the dominated the horizon of his side of the world, the mountain capped by the spaceport the humans had established ten years ago. `` I have never been there.'' Dorian's gaze returned to the little beast squatting in his home. `` Is it much like here?'' 
 
 The human did not answer. He seemed frightened, shrinking into himself. Dorian wondered why. He had never considered himself frightening. Was it his teeth? His horns? Dorian, kindly in his old age, took a step back, stroked his beard with his tail, and smiled. 
 
 `` What is your name, Earth-pilgrim?'' He adopted the tone he took with his three-times-great-grandchildren. Smooth, low, quiet. A lullaby tone, the sound of a tree rocking in the wind coming deep from the base of his throat. 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Your name. Earth creatures have names, I am correct, yes?'' 
 
 `` Q-47.'' Shame? Was that what Dorian was hearing? `` My name is Q-47.'' 
 
 `` That is a lovely name.'' A sly smile crept over the guest's face. `` What are you drinking?'' 
 
 `` Tea.'' 
 
 `` Tea?'' Dorian sniffed the air. `` What is a tea?'' 
 
 `` A drink made from hot water and leaves.'' His body was relaxing. He seemed less coiled, ready to spring away down the mountain, and faced Dorian more comfortably. He gestured to the tall teapot-topped camp stove behind him. `` Would you like some?'' Dorian nodded. Q-47 downed his cup and placed it between his knees while he turned around to search his bag. He pulled out a new cup, tin with a ceramic handle. He put his own cup in the bag and walked carefully over to the teapot to pour a new cup. He placed the steaming mug midway between the two of then before returning to his seat. 
 
 Dorian sniffed at it before dipping one of his two tongues in. Bitter, very bitter, but not completely unpleasant. `` You drink this on Earth?'' A nod in return. `` Hmm...'' He was not sure if he liked it, but did not want to be impolite to his new guest. He curled a tongue up into a long straw and sucked up the tea, boiling at a temperature that would have scalded any human mouth. `` Why here?'' 
 
 Relaxed, Q-47 opened up. `` I had heard stories about foreign worlds for my whole life. I wanted to explore the universe.'' 
 
 `` No, you misunderstand. Why this land? This valley and my mountain in it, surrounded by burning rock. Why?'' 
 
 `` It's beautiful here.'' 
 
 `` Is it?'' Dorian surveyed his kingdom. The sun was rising and the closest moon was setting. Together they illuminated the landscape, creating an odd shimmering dissonance of conflicting colors of light on the banks of the lava creeks. Fog was rolling in from the north across the ground in a thick cloud, vanishing as it confronted the heat of the molten rock, pushing its way around the mountain as a river would around a boulder dropped suddenly into its midst. To the west, directly behind the human, was the land he had come from. The vast, dense jungles of his former home. Dark, damp, full of life that glowed as brightly as his kind, sometimes brighter. If the traveler went deep, deep into that jungle he would find a clearing. In that clearing he would find a village of Kadappa like Dorian, some of whom were the kin of the mountain dweller himself. Dorian sighed at the thought. `` Yes, I suppose it is beautiful.'' 
 
 `` Why are you here?'' 
 
 Dorian tilted his head to the right, revealing the two long scars that marred his neck. Had he been a creature of the sea, they would have looked like gills. Dorian smiled at Q-47. `` My ascetic discipline. My mountain is my home. My place to be alone.'' Q-47 could not possibly understand what he meant, not completely at least. However, at some level, the level deep down in the gut where all true understanding lives, something. Q-47 pulled up the sleeve on his left arm. In large red block letters, the words'DAMAGED PRODUCT/DISCARD'. 
 
 Dorian said nothing for a little while. Neither did Q-47. They sat in silence, staring at the far off mountain. The sun rose. 
 
 `` How about another cup of tea?''

","Doh'tlec reviewed his message. It did n't need to contain much, just a few coordinates and a few words about what would be there. But the message was more than that. After the information was a story. The story contained all of the events of his life. From his first memory of coming out of his regeneration cell, to the invasion of his home planet only a few hours ago. All of his memories from his education, all of the times he met with his family, every idea he had shared were written down on the screen 
 
 He also included all of the evil he had seen. Doh'tlec told of his mistakes. His failures. His regrets. He told everything, seeing himself in a way that only someone about to die can see. And finally, he told of the history. The Kreef, with their predatory nature. How they discovered the ability to travel the stars, and all of the prey they found there. He told of the war, how the Kreef never lost and never retreated. He told how they had reached the ends of the galaxy, killing all in their way. And he told of how they were forced back. 
 
 Doh'tlec was one of the first to meet with the humans. They seemed even more vicious than the Kreef, but the humans had been willing to talk. He needed the help of humanity, but they demanded a price. Doh'tlec agreed to show them star travel. They had no idea how close they were to reaching it on their own, but they took the deal. And from that day, the Kreef never won a battle with the humans. The humans discovered the Kreef's weakness, and turned the tide almost instantly. He told how the Kreef were almost completely destroyed. 
 
 Doh'tlec heard thumping coming from outside his door, and knew his time was up. He sent the transmission, to be received by everyone with an Ansible. He heard the telltale beeping from his door. They loved to make their weapons beep. Doh'tlec raised his knife to his neck. They would not torture him. They would not take him alive to be made a toy. He cut, and his world exploded.

The terminal was wiped, but the message reappeared. `` We were wrong. The humans were not ready, they must be eliminated. Their home is Earth. Destroy it.''

","Night had long since fallen, a chill wind heralding the sun's retreat. The moon was large and bright in the sky. Stars hung like glimmering diamonds across an inky canvas, without a single cloud marring their beauty. All was still in the idyllic little suburban street. All, that was, save for a single small child. She trudged aimlessly across the asphalt, her tiny body trembling with exhaustion and dirty blonde hair matted against her skull. 
 
 The girl came to a shuddering stop outside a white picket fence. Her head lolled from side-to-side before jerking towards a house, her body following jerkily behind. Light still leaked through glazed windows, illuminating one dull blue eye staring in. A family sat inside. The mother and daughter sat huddled around a roaring fire, a thick wool blanket wrapped around them while they read from a small book. 
 
 Cold air wracked the watcher's already shivering frame but some tenuous reserves of willpower kept her from falling. She watched as the father emerged from their kitchen, holding a steaming mug in either hand. He gingerly handed them out and smiled when the daughter cheered excitedly. 
 
 It was almost voyeuristic, the way she stared in at them. Sensation lingered at the edge of her imagination: The roar of a well-stoked fire, the sweet scent of boiling chocolate, the warm embrace of loving parents. Tantalising reminders of a life she was torn away. 
 
 She shuffled towards the front door, each painstaking movement wrenching a muffled gasp from frozen lungs. A hand the colour of bone reached for the door and stopped just short. 
 
 In the stillness of night comes a sound. She heard it behind her, the scraping of something scaled against concrete. A shadow fell over the young girl, tendrils scything gently through the air. Desperate fear seized her heart and she lunged forward to rap her knuckles weakly against the door. The form behind her stopped suddenly, looming over her. Something wet dribbled down the girl's back. 
 
 There were sounds of movement behind the door. Breath caught in her lungs and for the briefest of moments, the girl allowed herself to hope. The door cracked open and a young child stared at her. Bright blue eyes peered out at her, golden locks hanging messily over her eyes. The fires of hope were extinguished as quickly as they had kindled. 
 
 `` Who is it, sweetheart?'' A woman's voice called from the living room. They stared at each other before the clean girl smirked, her face contorting in unnatural ways. 
 
 `` There's nothing there, mother.'' She called over her shoulder. `` Just a shadow.'' The bright-eyed doppleganger closed her door quietly. A grey, rubbery tentacle drapped itself across the shivering girl's shoulders. It was almost a comforting gesture. The fleshy appendage began to lead her broken form back down the path. 
 
 She let it.

","In a city of 35,000, and excluding those who worked over night or graveyard shifts, Becky was one of the early risers. She woke at 4:45 and was out on a brisk morning walk and exercise trip by the time the sun began to rise around 5:20 at that point in the summer. Becky walked quickly on the long windy sidewalks, out of the residential area and towards the downtown area, where she passed some of the other early risers: Olanna Ndibe, who owned a coffee shop/restaurant with excellent, excellent eggs benedict; Greg Sisco, who ran by with his goofy smile, lanky limbs, and delicious ass that Becky loved watched bouncing away; Xavier Gross, who walked across town to meet up with his carpoolers for the hour commute to work ( his house was amazing and so was his job. Worth the time ); Zy Redford, who had no problem letting you know his distant relation to Robert Redford as he filled up the gas tanks of people at one of the few full-service stations left in the country. 
 
 Becky passed these usual people then noticed that the store windows were not lit up at Avery Hall Consultants. It was owned by Gladys Wynter ( nee Avery ) who was the great grand-daughter of one of the city's big wig founders way back when. They opened at 5:30 to conduct business with clients in Europe, aligning with the European standard of having meetings between 10 and 1, rather than later or earlier. Becky usually walked past and, on the grassy corner, would do abs and back exercises after smiling in and waving to Gladys. She stopped, so confused that the store was dark. She leaned in to the window, made a hand visor, and peered into the darkness. No computer lights were blinking, no fish tank lights, no scarlet EXIT signs. It was as if the now present sun could not penetrate the glass. 
 
 Becky stood back up and looked around. Other business seemed normal. Above, the apartments had the usual one or two lights on. And, the beautiful, tall woman who sometimes emerged from the access door did so and nodded and moved on. Becky always wanted to get her name, but her departure time in the morning was less than consistent. 
 
 Becky passed on, got to the corner, and began her sit-ups, lifts, planks, flexes, twists, and jumps. As she finished her set, she looked up to see the sun finally erupting over the large hill in town, the bottom of its sphere departing from the crest of the hill: its rocket border now having to fly across the sky with no land to rest on. She loved looking at it as much as her eyes would allow her to. She turned to walk then froze, as if gently punched in the gut.'Something's wrong' she thought. She turned and looked back and did n't see the shadow of the monument. The tall man with on top of a pedestal on top of the hill. Where was he. She would see him now and then closer when she stopped outside the firehouse to do pushups. He was n't there. No pedestal. No man. She saw no outline of it laying down. It was a humongous work. No one could have stolen it short of a fleet of helicopters or trucks, and surely there'd have been sirens. Where is it? 
 
 Again, Becky felt another punch to the gut, resulting in a knot that wound tighter and tighter like an anaconda trying to choke itself out. That statue was of the Avery who founded the town. The Avery who was the great-grandfather of Gladys. She turned back and ran to the windows of Avery Hall Consultants. She banged on them,'Gladys! Gladys'. Nothing. By now, surely, Gladys' second in command Ellen would have shown up. Ellen. Ellen... what? Ellen... Seymour. Okay. No! Ellen Seymour's mother is Gladys' cousin. Ellen is an Avery too. 
 
 Becky ran to where she knew she'd see a cop. As she ran towards it, the officer stepped out with wide eyes mirroring Becky's.'What is it, ma'am?''Something's wrong.''Wrong how?''All the Averys are gone.''What Averys?''Gladys and Ellen and the statue!' Becky said as she turned and pointed up the hill to where the statue stood tall, looking over the city as it always does. Becky's jaw went slack and she turned again and ran to the window of the consulting firm. The officer gave chase, asking Becky to stop and explain. 
 
 Becky reached the window. Inside, Gladys walked about as did Ellen. Passing Becky through the front door went one of the office workers. She banged on the window, screamed and ran inside the office. 
 
'Gladys! You were n't. and The Statue of your great-grandfather. And the office was so dark.' Becky verbally vomited on Gladys. Gladys put her hands on her shoulder and looked at her calmly.'What do you mean?''All the Averys were missing not 5 minutes ago. And now you're here.' The officer appeared inside the building and Gladys flagged him over to where she had sat Becky down in a chair.'There was blackness. And the sun rose. And there was no.''Becky's it's going to be okay. We're all fine. I got here when I always do. Were you running early today?''But what about the statue?''You're right, what about that?' said Gladys as Ellen appeared behind Gladys and plunged a syringe into her neck.

 Jason knew the biters would catch him soon. His uncle had fallen to them only minutes ago, but he knew they would finish their work on him soon and come next for him. He and his uncle had come south hoping that they might escape the biters that plagued Atlanta, but they were wrong, the foul things were everywhere. No safe place existed. 
 
 As he rounded a crumbling building that looked like it used to house a great many families, Jason discovered an odd sort of track. It was made of concrete, and the track ran way up in the air. What kind of vehicle had ridden up so high? There was a ladder along one of the pillars supporting the track, and Jason scampered to the top. Maybe the biters would lose his trail if he walked the rail high above them. 
 
 Jason followed the track until he saw a sight pulled straight from the tattered books his mother treasured when he was a child: A castle. Spires jutting toward the sky, Jason had never seen anything like it. It lay beyond a large wall set with many small gates, all chained shut. One of the ancient gates had rusted nearly through and lay at an angle, held up only by the chain meant to keep visitors out. 
 
 The rusted hinge broke easily enough, but it came with a cost. Jason heard the telltale hiss of the biters as the metal gave way with a snap. He wiggled through the opening, and tried to hurriedly hide his tracks before dashing towards the castle. Once past the gate, Jason discovered a small village. The shops looked long abandoned, with broken windowpanes and holes in the roofs. Amazingly, the drawbridge of the castle lay open, and Jason dashed across the threshold. 
 
 Inside, the castle was not the fortress Jason had hoped. It seemed to serve more as an entrance, opening up to more odd houses beyond. Jason fell to his knees in despair. The biters would find him soon, and he would be ended. 
 
 The booms jolted Jason so, that he fell prostrate on the stone street. He turned his wide eyes to the sky just in time to see three large explosions light the night. Instead of fire, bright sparks of red, blue, and white littered the sky and floated like snowflakes. Only, one of the sparks did not fall. One of the sparks grew, and began to flit around the sky like an angry hornet. 
 
 The sight was so awe-inspiring, that Jason forgot his pursuers and ran back through the castle gate. The angry spark flew low, skimming the foul water ringing the castle at such speed that it threw spray into the air. Crossing in front of the castle, the spark took to the sky in a wide arc over the spires of the castle. As it crested the ancient building, it showered everything below with soft flakes of light. 
 
 The soft lights fluttered down until touching the buildings and ground below. Instead of fading, the buildings seemed to soak up the light like cracked earth took water. All around him, the buildings themselves took on the glow. Windows stitched themselves whole, colors on the walls put spring flowers to shame, and the lights on the street and in the homes flickered to life.

 Robotic nannies shaped roughly like humans although with a white polymer coating and a smiling face mask were the only contact with the outside world that the children ever got. Food and drink were sent in via vacuum tubes and waste was disposed of in a like manner. Even water for bathing came through heavily screened pipes.

 Scientists at Stanford University are about to undergo a brand new research project on the way we sleep. They are attempting to find connections between different dreams that people have, and attempt to find an overall `` storyline'' to the dreams we have. Is this the beginning of a new way we look at our sleep? We'll find out in a couple months. Now in only a few moments we'll have Ed with the weather, so stay tuned.

 April 13th 
 
 Now here's something different. Stanford researchers did in fact find a link between dreams. When subjects were put into a state of trance with no distractions or influences, they were able to recount dreams with an overall idea and theme, each occurring chronologically to form a coherent idea. These testers were also able to recall exact events of their dreams with about as much precision as they have with their real life.

 April 30th 
 
 Remember those researchers who found connections inside dreams? Well, controversy about the project is spreading, with some people claiming that the researchers used illegal drugs to get their results. Stanford has denied all claims of drug use on the campus, saying `` We would never do that.'' Coming up next, a strange creature spotted in a nearby lake.

 Researchers at Stanford with rumors of using drugs have just come out with a paper publishing their findings. They claim that through a method of sleep induction, test subjects can remember their'lives' while dreaming. In fact, some subjects have began to claim they remember their sleeping selves better than their waking ones.

 An investigation into the Stanford sleep research finds something shocking. According to experts, some volunteers were put into an extended coma, and have n't woken up in days. The researchers claim that they never intended for anyone to be put into coma, but because of the nature of the testing, they believe something else is afoot, and must continue research. Some petitions have begun to shut the project down, but none have near the amount of signatures needed.

 May 23rd 
 
 Scientists at Stanford have another bold announcement to make. They claim that the people who strangely fell into a coma as part of an experiment have just been woken up after four days of pure sleep. The subjects' vitals and nutrition content are completely normal, despite their lack of food and water. The subjects claim that they were awake the whole time, or in some kind of other world, while others claim that the world we live in is a dream in itself.

 The Sleeping Life Experiment, as it has begun to be called, has still been going on this whole time. For those who do n't know, subjects have gone without food, water, or vitals for weeks. They are woken up once every 4 to 5 days for checkups, and in that time, they appear delirious. All of the subjects claim the same thing now, which is that they live their lives inside of their dreams, and see us as the dream world now.

 June 15th 
 
 Unofficial documents from the Sleeping Life Experiment have surfaced, showing the tactics they used to induce these strange comas. According to these instructions, the methods used did contain high amounts of drug use, and nearly overdosed every subject with a dangerous chemical mixture. Now that these instructions have been posted online, some people have begun to follow them without supervision. We advise all people to stay away from replicating these experiments, and do not endorse any methods explained in the procedure.

This combination of chemicals both illegal and legal have incredible consequences. After one dosage, people begin to fall asleep, and rarely wake up. No one has ever died from use of the drug, and scientists are baffled at the way users defy the need for nutrients.

 When I first woke here, I instantly recognized this place as Hell. The fire and brimstone made it kinda obvious. But I was confused when there was the complete lack of any one but me. There were n't even any demons to torture me. Just.... empty. 
 I wandered around a bit looking for any other soul. I later expanded my search to include demons. Hell, I'd be happy to even see Satan himself. I searched for what seemed like weeks, It was just me alone in this wasteland. 
 After a while I gave up looking and just sat there. My mind was beginning to snap. I decided to try and escape this world by attempting to kill myself. I quickly learned that no matter how much pain you're in, you can not die. Hell wo n't let go so easy. 
 My mind was completely gone by now; taken by loneliness. The next couple of weeks-or were they months? -were blurry. After an eternity, I regained my sanity. I did some more exploring and found a somewhat less inhospitable area to call my home. 
 I lost my sanity again, and when it came back, I realized my sanity can be split into cycles. Those cycles further split into sanity and insanity. I will leave these journal entries whenever I can.

 He stops for a second, looking back into the room. It was a female voice. When the light was on, he had only glanced long enough to register long, sandy blonde hair and a large, loose jacket. Now it was too dark to make out anything but an outline. He stood at the door for a second, squinting into the darkness before turning away again.

She seemed content with his choice, and leaned back against the fall, looking up. He still watched, waiting for her to cry or throw up or do whatever drunk girls do. After a while he also leaned back, looking up. He tried to sit. And think. Like he had originally intended to. But he could n't. As long as she was there, he was uncomfortable. He pulled out his phone. She did, too. They passed at least half an hour in without speaking. Eventually, after watching him scroll down his phone and snicker for several minutes, she narrowed her eyes and asked, `` Are you on reddit?'' 
 
 Unsure what her tone implied and slightly upset at being called out, he just glared at her.

Although he did not know it, she did the same. Eventually, tired of this fruitless exchange, she pulls a pair of earbuds out of her pocket and begins listening to music on her phone. After some time has passed, she relaxes, and the phone slides out of her hand, resting on her leg. He glances over again, and sees the screen. 
 
 `` I love the Milk Carton Kids.'' 
 
 He's somewhat surprised that he just spoke. His words were more instinctual reaction to finding someone else who actually listened to the Milk Carton Kids than attempt to communicate. 
 
 She looks up, more confused than skeptical. `` Really?'' 
 
 His words are quiet and once again directed at the ground. `` Yeah. I probably listen to all of *Retrospect* 8 or 9 times a week. I mean, like, if I had brought my earbuds I'd probably be on Broken Headlights the second time around by now. Or maybe T*he Ash & Clay*. Depends on the mood''. 
 
 She smiled at him. `` Rookie mistake.'' Then, after a few minutes, `` Come here, we can share.'' 
 
 He scooted over to her and accepted the ear bud. 
 
 Their conversation proceeded infrequently, words spoken between songs, 
 both of which each one of them took great care in selecting. 
 
 `` I was on reddit.'' 
 
 She smiled, then, after a few moments. `` I knew it. Actually, I was, too.'' 
 
 Later, `` Why did you ask me to come in?'' 
 
 `` It's less likely that a couple would try to bust in here and get it on if they think there's already a couple here.'' 
 
 `` Wait, would they do that? Like, with you just sitting here?'' 
 
 `` It's happened if they're drunk enough.'' 
 
 `` Oh.'' 
 
 Later, yet. `` Okay, that was partially true.'' 
 
 Silence. He just turns toward her. Not to look into her eyes, but rather his gaze now falls somewhere around her kneecaps. 
 
 `` You know how sometimes you want to just sit alone in the dark for a bit?'' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` Like you just need to get out. Away from the people, away from everything. Take a break.'' 
 
 `` Mhm'' 
 
 `` Well, sometimes you just want to sit alone in the dark with someone.'' 
 
 He turned again, and he met her eyes.

26715,"[ WP ] Write a creation myth .
","A darkness erupted and became that of the soul that is the present. Another explosion of the mind created the past and the future. Together, the Present, Past and Future flowed without word down into the streams of time, mixing, matching, melding into a perfect storm. 
 
 
 This storm swirled, creating a whirlpool of time. Without conscience, anything could go from the present to the past, and to the future in an instant. It was good for a time. 
 
 
 Until the Past and Future streamed together. A violent storm of mythical powers emerged, too powerful for either flow to become steady. Only by chance did Present flow in between the two flows to separate the streams. 
 
 
 With the storm that emerged from the Future and Past combining, small fragments of time materialized. Flowing into present, these fragments formed the world Perishajn. As strong bearing resemblance to the original streams of time, there lay three Pangaea continents. One dominated over the other two, in which time began it's slow march. On the other two continents, time flowed as the Past and the Future, quickly or slowly. 
 
 
 The creatures of the dominant continent grew the quickest. Four nations quickly emerged from nothing. Four tribes, four kingdoms, four powers. 
 
 
 Powers that grow quickly, grow quickly to temper. 
 
 
 War was inevitable. Death became a norm. As so the time flowed on, in it's three streams. 
 
 
 During a brief period of silence that was peace, four individuals, one from each kingdom arose and met in secret. They sought peace for eternity, to appease that which had created them. 
 
 
 And so, in calling down the powers of time, the Past, Future and Present to observe the four of them, to be bound in a brotherhood. 
 
 
 But time, being indifferent, did not come down. It watched from afar, and only beginning to sense it's own self-awareness, watched carefully. 
 
 
 The four brothers went to each kingdom's rulers, preaching peace and harmony. No king heeded their advice. 
 
 
 Once more, there was war. During this instance, the brotherhood took shelter in a cave, and once more called down time to intervene. 
 
 
 In a moment of clarity and self-awareness, Time awoken, along with it's three forms, the Past, Present and Future. 
 
 
 They came to the cave, and heard the plea for peace. 
 
 
 In Time's wisdom, it gave them a choice. Either to join time to watch the kingdoms rise and fall, or tempt fate and gaze into the Future. 
 
 
 Their youth guided them to be idealistic, but powerful decision. They tempted fate and gazed into the Past, to where they had been, gazed upon their failure. Time reminded them, that they will not be the last to commit such failures in the name of peace. 
 
 
 They turned to gaze into the present, looking into a mirror of events. Time then reminded them that you can not see past this point without true clarity without watching your past failures. 
 
 
 Before they gazed into the Future, Time hesitated in the three forms. He spoke softly as he stated that gazing into the Future was dangerous, not least since the Past and Future can not touch. Gazing into the Future may change the Present, but could never change the Past. Could they survive the guilt of future failure with past failure? Could they redeem themselves with treacherous misdeeds later? 
 
 
 The brothers chose to gaze, for the sake of peace. 
 
 
 But what they saw, was not peace. They saw war. An ever turning wheel of peace, war, death, birth and finally, their own deaths. 
 
 
 After viewing all of this, Time gave it's final verdict. Live through this now, or sacrifice themselves and join Time in the observance of the universe. 
 
 
 The brothers proposed a deal. If Time would seek to divide the kingdoms now to seek peace for a thousand years and beyond, they would join Time. 
 
 
 Time took time to think about it. Only after much pleading, did Time agree. 
 
 
 He said that the transformation would be painful, but worth the journey. 
 
 
 As the brothers transcended reality into the space of Time, with Time, they left only one message. 
 
 
 `` We Four Brothers, We Four Saints, shall dispel the madness that is War for all to prosper.'' 
 
 
 Screaming their entire way through to the other side, all war stopped immediately. 
 
 
 They heard the screams. 
 
 
 After they were gone, each of the kings sent runners to seek the source of the screams. Each king visited the site and saw the fallen bodies of the respective brother and agreed, for their sake, they would not wage war again. 
 
 
 From then, all men and women hail to the peacemakers, the Four Screaming Saints, may they rest in peace.

 Don ’ t look them in the eyes. Don ’ t draw it out. Don ’ t mention their family, friends -- just keep your goddamned mouth shut. The closer it seems to a force-fed nap the better. Don ’ t smile, don ’ t smirk, Jesus man, don ’ t gloat. Just get in, make it quick and quiet, and get the hell out.

 I take the rules serious. And no, it ’ s not some pansy emo bullshit -- because, for serious, I wouldn ’ t look good in skinny jeans and I never learned to play guitar, dude. It ’ s just that you don ’ t need any distractions, you know? You ’ re a professional. That and the pictures. 
 
 I know it sounds like shit out of a movie, but what is it they say about art? How like, art copies life and stuff. My mom always said that there was truth in every lie, and I think, you know, it ’ s like that sort of.

Pretty much the most exciting thing I ever see are some saggy hooker boobs, you puking at the afterbirth spilling out of your ugly wife ’ s massive cunt.

 She paused, catching the expression I could n't avoid betraying. She sighed. 
 
 `` Okay, maybe that's not the term to use with you. But they are stepping forward, out of the goodness of their hearts, and doing something that gives all the benefit to others, for nothing more than to help. Is n't that noble, at the least?'' 
 
 I turned back to the window, leveling my gaze at the ward through the blinds. 
 
 `` Martha. Semantics aside, I can only know my situation, my burden that I carried.'' I watched as a woman laid her hand on a child in bed. Her mouth moved, she smiled, and I watched as the markings moved off the child's face, down his arm and up her fingers. Her eyes fluttered shut, determined to hold back the screams as the pain threatened to overwhelm her, overtake her. 
 
 `` Thomas, we are the ones who can only know our own problems, our own pain. You were the one who always told me that humans are selfish, even cold, when it comes to our own survival. Those stories of yours from the war? I do n't know what you saw, what you heard, much less what you felt. But these people,'' her voice was straining now, and I turned back to catch sight of the tears that trailed along her cheekbone. `` These people, they're doing what they can. Sometimes more, in order to instill that old ideal I know you still hold out for in all of us.'' 
 
 There was a muffled thud. The woman was on the floor, convulsing as the aides hurried to pull her from the room. The boy's eyes fluttered open, and I watched as his face contorted, lunging against the restraints around him at the woman being removed from his room. Martha coughed, trying to cover her sobbing. 
 
 I closed my eyes. I reached for that old familiar feeling, the burning now long absent within me. It had only been four months, but it was four months that I wish I could redo. 
 
 `` Whatever the reason, the ideal, is it really justified, when in the end, these families are still torn asunder? If this process were possible without a familial link....'' my voice left me, and I shuddered. 
 
 Martha reached forward, gripping my arm. She knew well as I did. Parents and children. That was the stipulation. We could cure someone, anyone, of anything. But the laws of the universe extend further than we had feared, and those illnesses must be conserved. But even that was n't the final irony. It would be the link between generations in the most immediate sense, that would leave us still at the mercy of fate's cruel humor. And so, parents could take those pains and agonies from their child, sometimes as the ultimate example of love, so that their sons and daughters could prosper in their stead. 
 
 And, as I had found, the process was mutual. 
 
 `` Lily had her right in that decision.'' I pulled my arm away, but Martha continued. `` I know how you feel --'' 
 
 `` Do you? You took Billy's diabetes. That is entirely treatable. I'm not sure that gives you entitlement in understanding my position.'' The burning was n't there. It would never be there again. Just like her. `` You have Billy. You have your son. All I know, is I would trade the sickness of everyone in this hospital for Lily instead.'' 
 
 Martha opened her mouth, then closed it again. I turned and watched the boy through the glass, passed out in exhaustion. His mother should be fine. The burns were severe. But she would likely survive, with persistent care. 
 
 Lily would not be fine. She would not come back. I fondled the silver chain on my wrist, the dates inscribed with her birth and death. A constant reminder of that young woman, whom I felt ashamed to love, when I am here and she is not. 
 
 `` She was eighteen. That is the absolute legal limit for consent, but it's there in the legislation. She was allowed to make her choice. And you ca n't undo that now.'' Martha turned to the door, pausing long enough to glance back at me. I met her gaze. `` Ca n't you at least be thankful? She would n't want this tp be your reaction forever.'' She left, and I was left alone. 
 
 No burning. No Lily. Never again.

260164,"[ WP ] You were born into a nomadic tribe . When you decide to stay behind , you discover who/what you ’ ve been running from all this time .
","It had been three full days since the tribe had left Og behind, not that he knew that, unable to keep track of time. His leg had never healed quite right after he broke it, and the tribe could waste no more time on caring for him. They had to stay ahead of the shadow. Stay ahead or die. That was the one rule. 
 
 So they left him in the shade of a giant elm near the top of the hill. They left him with enough food to last a few days, though the merciful thing would have been to leave him with none. Why keep him alive long enough to be consumed by the shadow? Why leave him to be, if his Nana ’ s stories were to be believed, ripped apart and put back together as some horrid creature. Death would be better. Starvation would be better. 
 
 Alas, Og ’ s will to die was weaker than the hunger pangs he suffered, and soon enough he dug into the rations of berries and cornmeal the tribe had left him. In three days time, the food was gone and he was back to the hunger that had conquered him. Now he spent half his time suffering from starvation and the other half fearing the shadow ’ s arrival. 
 
 Desperate solutions raced through Og ’ s mind. “ Maybe I could hide from it when they come. If I can stand on my leg I may be able to climb the tree and the Shadow will not see me. Then I can find food when it is gone! ” But try as Og might, he could not bear the pain of standing long enough to climb the tree. 
 
 After the fifth attempt to stand, Og collapse on the ground in defeat. He had resigned himself to the shadow. Soon, the monster that his tribe had spent their entire lives fleeing would be upon him. He could do nothing but wait. 
 
 It came that day while Og was napping. 
 
 It wasn ’ t with a shriek or yell like in the stories his Nana had told him when he was a child. There were no rabid dogs that dug into his flesh like his Nana ’ s stories described. But there was the cold. A cold so sharp it was enough to jolt Og awake, even in the high heat of the sun. 
 
 Og looked up to see a man dressed in all black carrying a bag at his side. The man ’ s skin was tan and wrinkled, almost as if his entire body was dried out. The man was now staring directly at Og with a piercing gaze. When he spoke, a surprisingly gentle voice came out. 
 
 “ You know who I am? ” 
 
 Og spoke, mustering all the energy and will he could to keep his voice stable. “ You are the shadow. ” 
 
 The man smiled wide, revealing a blindingly white line of jagged teeth along his mouth. 
 
 “ The Shadow?! That ’ s a new one. I ’ ve been called many things by many tribes from many lands. ” The man looked up in the sky and stroked his chin. “ The shadow? I like that. Makes me sound helpful. Like the shadow of a great tree that protects the weak from this hot and blistering sun. Yessir! ” The man looked back down at Og, smiling so wide his face seemed to be split in half. “ Call me the shadow. ” 
 
 “ You come to kill me? ” 
 
 The man ’ s smile vanished and in its place was a nasty looking scowl. “ Who told you that? ” 
 
 “ My people say the shadow destroys. ” 
 
 “ I suppose that ’ s right, in a sense. I destroy. I destroy the chains that keep one bound to a life of ignorance and futility. Do you know what those words mean, Og? Ignorance and futility? ” 
 
 Og shook his head. 
 
 “ No matter, Og. You will soon enough. ” 
 
 And with that the man reached into his bag. Og braced himself for the unimaginable weapon that would send him to the afterlife. Instead, to Og ’ s surprise, the man produced a red piece of fruit, no larger than a human fist. 
 
 “ This is a fruit you haven ’ t seen before. It comes from a land far West of here. I assure you, it ’ s delicious. ” 
 
 Og ’ s stomach rumbled at the mere sight of food. The man seemed to sense his hunger. 
 
 “ I ’ m going to give you a choice. Stay here and die in the heat of the sun, or eat the fruit in my hand and live. ” 
 
 For Og, it wasn ’ t a decision at all. Og snatched at the fruit almost instantly. 
 
 “ There ’ s a good boy. Now eat up. ” 
 
 Og bit deep into the red ball, the sweet juice exploded from the bite and dribbled down his chin. “ My god, the sweetness! ” Og thought. It was even sweeter than the honey Nana had given him when he was just a child. 
 
 “ How do you feel? ” The man asked, his terrifying smile starting to return. “ Take another bite. ” 
 
 Og did, and with that second bite the sun over him vanished. The sun that had shone on his father and his father before him, the sun that had been over his head while he played with his brothers and sisters, the sun that had lit the path of his people… no more. In its place was a different sensation. A sensation Og had never felt before. 
 
 “ How ’ s the leg, Og? ” 
 
 Og shifted his weight on the leg. It still hurt, but the pain seemed to matter less to him now. For the first time during their meeting, Og now stood up to the man, a full head taller than him. 
 
 The man stared deep into Og ’ s eyes. “ I should be going now. There are many others starving for my fruit. ” With that, the man turned around and began to walk away. 
 
 Og spoke and was surprised to find the words come out quicker than he was used to. “ What do I do now? ” 
 
 The man laughed a harsh, sharp laugh like the caw of a crow. “ Whatever you desire, my friend. You are under my shadow now, not his sun. You and your children will always know my fruit and my shadow. ” 
 
 Og looked down at the red fruit in his hand. The inside, once yellow and frothing with juice, had now become dry and brown. 
 
 Og looked up to call after the man, but there was no one there. Just the empty valley that lay covered in a vast shadow. 
 
 Og felt cold.

99816,"[ WP ] After both of your parents have passed away , you return to your childhood home to finally open a bedroom door that for as long as you remember had remained locked .
","The house was never as big, when I pulled up in front of it, as it seemed in my memories. When I was a child it was a palace fit for kings and queens. Now it was just a rambling old building of red brick and Tudor black and white in a quiet village in north Cheshire. Quiet and lonely behind its walls and trees, its rooms full of dust and memory. 
 
 I parked my car on the gravel driveway and approached the front door, my finger hovering over the doorbell before I remembered, and the pain of it hit me like a punch in the stomach. Dad passed away six years ago and I didn ’ t miss him, I hardly even knew him. But losing Mum was like losing a part of my soul. 
 
 I reached into my pocket for the key and opened the door. 
 
 Everything looked just the same as it did last time I was here, before she had the stroke. It smelt a bit; musty from being closed and empty for six weeks. And cold. 
 
 The living room, like the rest of the house, was neat and tidy except for a magazine and a half-empty cup on the coffee-table, the drink inside curdled and mouldy. She was sitting right here when it happened. I picked up the cup, took it to the kitchen and emptied it in the sink. A vase of wilted flowers sat on the windowsill and I sighed as I dropped them into the bin. Mum always loved Chrysanthemums. 
 
 She and I were very close, as mothers and sons often are. Even after work took me to London, I would visit most weekends and talk to her on the phone every other day. With no other children to occupy her attention, and with Dad already gone, I guessed she was lonely up here on her own. 
 
 I went upstairs and opened the door to my own room, where I would sleep when I stayed overnight. Some of the mementos of my childhood were still there. Books I couldn ’ t bear to part with but had no room for in my poky little Camden flat. The trophies I won for athletics in school. A photo of me at the beach with my first girlfriend. I didn ’ t even remember her name. 
 
 I dropped my backpack on the floor and turned to go back downstairs, then my attention was caught by the door at the end of the hall. The door to the room that was always locked. Mum always refused to tell me why and over the years we ’ d joked about it. She was harbouring a body in there. Or it was her sex dungeon where she would take clients for a whipping. Or her secret lair from which she conducted the life of a super-criminal. But she never told me the truth. 
 
 I found the key in her bedroom. It still felt wrong to be searching through her drawers, her personal possessions, even though technically it was all mine now. It was an old-fashioned brass key with a small pink ribbon tied to the top. I sat staring at it for a long time. 
 
 What right do I have, to go prying into my mother ’ s personal secrets? She kept the truth from me for a reason; whether that reason was right or wrong it was important to her, and was it wrong for me to break her trust like this? 
 
 But a practical side of me took over. I must sell the house. I must empty it. All of it, even this room. 
 
 With a pounding heart I put the key into the lock, turned it, and slowly opened it. What I saw in there almost broke my heart. 
 
 It was a nursery. 
 
 All decorated in pink; an old-fashioned cot with pink sheets. Rows of cuddly toys, dusty but otherwise looking almost new, untouched. Pictures from Beatrix Potter all over the walls; Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, Squirrel Nutkin. Everything was old and yet at the same time, still new. 
 
 I picked up one of the toys, a fluffy white rabbit, and brushed the dust off it. Its orange glass eyes seemed to smile at me. 
 
 On the dresser, there was a faded photograph in a frame of my mother when she was much younger, holding a baby. Beside the photograph was a candle, half burned down. And beside that, a white card with a picture of a dove embossed on the front. 
 
 I opened the card and read the words. 
 
 * “ In loving memory. Emily Jane Townsend. 4th June 1972 – 16th January 1973. ” * 
 
 A sister. An older sister, gone years before I was born. 
 
 I sank to the ground, buried my face in the rabbit ’ s fur and I wept.

 `` Oh yeah? What kind of a dream? Is it a sexy dream? ``, Jainey giggled and snuggled under her boyfriends arm. She loved that place, that's where she always felt safe, and he knew it. In all honesty, he loved her there too, especially after sex. 
 
 `` Kind of.'' 
 
 She did n't move a bit, but she was distraught when she heard this. In silence, Mark let out a sigh. 
 
 `` Never mind, I do n't think it's that important.'' 
 
 Mark closed his eyes and Jainey's hair was laying across his chest and her head was listening to the beats of his heart which was beating for another. He did n't know the name of that other girl, but her face was etched in his mind since he was fourteen. That is the time he first started to even think about love and like all teenagers, he idolized it as this out-of-this-world feeling which takes all the pain away and replaces it with joy and it lasts forever. 
 
 He stood up and started dressing. 
 
 `` What are you doing? Come back.'' 
 
 `` I'm hot.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, you are.'' 
 
 `` No, I mean it, let's go for a walk. Maybe get some ice cream.'' 
 
 `` You had me at'ice cream'.'' 
 
 They both laughed and as Jainiey was slowly putting on her clothes and'no makeup' makeup, Mark drifted off. He's been with her for two years now and it's been pretty good, and although there were some bumps and bruises here and there, he knew that he loved her. 
 
 Jainiey purred while hugging his arm and they went for a walk. 
 
 They walked silently, Jainiey drunk in love, and Mark haunted by his dreams. 
 
 The girl in them was petite, and had a short black hair which he never liked on any other girl but her. A few freckles laid beneath her stormy green eyes and the soft move of her lips when she smiled could melt ice caps. 
 
 As he grew, she grew with him, and was always there for him. 
 
 *But she is n't real*, he had remind himself. That was the most heart shattering thought he ever had. His one true love is n't real. He felt psychotic because of that and never told anyone about her. Yet, his dreams continued. And in them, he knew true happiness and never for a second did he even doubt their reality. 
 
 And as he bought Jainiey ice cream, and turned around there she was. 
 
 Standing in line behind them, short black hair freckles under beautiful green eyes. 
 
 Her mouth was open and so was his and they stood there in awe of each other. And as his lips pressed together to utter a sound, Jainiey pulled him away. 
 
 `` You're holding up the line, Mark.'' 
 
 She almost dragged him for few more feet, but Mark never lost eye contact with the girl of his dreams. Oblivious, Jainiey poked his nose with the ice cream and then licked it off while giggling like a school girl. And annoyed smile flashed on his face before he gave her a quick kiss. 
 
 As he turned back to the ice cream stand, the girl was gone. He knew that was her. And he knew that she recognized him too. 
 
 But, he never dreamed of her again.

 And once again, it's quiet. Even my hairless friend ca n't bring himself to words. All that work to track me down on a hunch made from security camera footage and supposed eye witnesses. Which come to think of it.......begs a question. 
 `` How many poor motherfuckers did you shoot in the arm BEFORE you found me?!?!'' 
 
 Baldy's gaze finally meets mine again. `` Mr. Morgan, the people I work for have certain resources. Resources that they would be willing to share if you were to cooperate with us.'' 
 
 `` Listen Vin Diesel, I only have two rules. Never makes deals with people who do n't have faces or names and never go to the grocery store on an empty stomach. That only leads to five too many packages of Oreos and low self-esteem problems.'' 
 
 ``.....Fine. My Special Agent Gregory Watson. Happy?'' 
 
 `` No.'' 
 
 `` What? Why not?'' 
 
 `` Because that's not your real name.'' 
 
 `` Yes. Yes it is.'' 
 
 `` No. No it's not.'' 
 
 He sighs and looks down at his shoes. `` No... it's not. But my name is not important. Who I work for is. Mr. Morgan, have you heard of Raymond Hurtz?'' 
 
 `` Yeah. He runs a small drug smuggling business in Yemen. He's a nobody.'' 
 
 `` Not anymore. The people we work for,'' he says, gesturing to his large muscular pals who are now staring at me too, `` They are n't a governing body. They are a council of about thirty different government leaders world wide. W.O.C. has been working for over 50 years to take down threats that are deemed to hazardous to be left alone. We are n't a government agency and have no country of origin, so we therefore do n't hold any legal boundaries.'' 
 
 I nod. `` W.O.C.?'' 
 
 `` World Order Council.'' 
 
 `` Hahahaha. Cute name. Listen guys, you got the wrong guy. One, I'm not a good team player and two, I'm not a good person.'' 
 
 `` You have n't even heard about what we can offer you.'' 
 
 `` Is it a cookie and a gold star?'' 
 
 `` How about restoring function to your damaged nerves?'' 
 
 What the fuck did he just say?! I feel an overwhelming need to leap from my chair and wrapping my hands around his throat. Is that asshole joking about this? 
 
 `` Do n't you want that?'' he says when I do n't respond, `` I'm no doctor, but I know that severe nerve damage does n't just stop the pain. When's the last time you felt the water from your shower run down your back? Or enjoyed the warmth from your cup of coffee?'' I'm still silent. He is n't lying. I have worked with mob bosses and thieves all my life, I can tell when a man is lying. He is n't. The rage I feel in my chest begins to subside, but I do n't want it to. I want to be angry, but ca n't. He's right. 
 
 `` Well, if you decide that maybe the nameless and faceless people are worth your time. Let me know.'' At that word, Henchman number one and two come at me with that stupid hood again. 
 
 `` NO NO NO! Wait, what did you mean when you said Hurtz is n't in the drug smuggling business anymore!'' 
 
 `` We will discuss more if you take the job, Mr. Morgan. Goodbye. I have a feeling we will meet again.'' 
 
 `` Ohhhh fuck yo-.'' They gagged me this time. THEY FUCKING GAGGED ME. Once again I'm dragged away through hallways and into a vehicle. It's about ten minutes before I'm dumped in a puddle in an alleyway. I take off my hood and look around to orientate myself. `` Well shit.''

161187,"[ WP ] Humanity 's last act of defiance against a more advanced and powerful alien race .
","The blasts from the surface confirmed what they'd feared. They'd been discovered. 
 
 It was probably inevitable. For some, maybe; in a twisted, horrible sense, it was welcome. A few had lived out their entire lives in the massive underground shelter. Other had n't, and had given up on living out their lives any longer. 
 
 Marc ran and grabbed his M56 rifle, and loaded a magazine. The attackers would win a Pyrrhic victory if there was anything he could do about it. 
 
 Colonel Lysonov was shouting orders, seemed, for the first instance in a long time, truly alive. 
 
 `` First section! Forward positions, now! Set up the MG15s in the tertiary shields. Let's give them hell!'' 
 
 They were the last holdouts. Company B, 3rd Battalion, United Nations Special Operations Force. The finest and most elite troops ever fielded by humanity. Not enough, but this would be there day. Even among their enemies, they would be revered as the warriors they were. 
 
 Marc flipped his rifle to automatic and pushed his way through the fleeing and panicking civilians. They would head for the lowest levels, where they would make their last stand. 
 
 `` It's about damned time.'' said the Brit, Hopkins, `` Let's give it to'em.'' 
 
 Marc nodded, and moved to his position. The advance guard was already falling back, and they would continue to swap positions, making the most of their meagre manpower. 
 
 He fired as the first targets presented themselves. The invaders were vaguely humanoid, and fierce fighters. They bashed their way through the first lines, often in hand to hand combat; attempting to rush the rear positions. With each burst of the rifle, Marc dropped an enemy. 
 
 When they were almost on top of him, he retreated. The aliens gave chase, and he knew he could n't outrun them. He also knew he did n't have to. As he dropped to the ground, the big rotary-barreled MG15s opened fire, reducing their targets to sludge. 
 
 He fell back again, and took position, others falling into line along side him. 
 
 `` Come on, come on, this is what we been waitin' for.'' murmured one of the men down the line. 
 
 Secretly, Marc agreed. He was done hiding. They would fight to the death, in the spirit of the Spartan 300, in the finest warrior tradition. 
 
 Again, their adversaries charged, and again, they were cut down under a withering barrage of rifle fire. But the attackers returned fire, plasma bolts striking nearby troopers, and the humans' fire began to slacken. One of the aliens, a centurion, by the look of his armor, roared, and the rest of the invaders charged onwards. 
 
 The Colonel, Lysonov, still lived, and now he drew a wicked-looking knife. 
 
 `` Davay! Davay!'' he shouted. `` Come get some!'' 
 
 He lunged forward, plunging the blade deep into the nearest enemy. Others followed his example, firing pistols and attacking with blades and bayonets. 
 
 `` Sanders!'' Marc turned, and Lieutenant Zhu looked at him. `` To the bottom. It's the Alamo.'' he said. 
 
 Marc nodded, the Deep Level Shelter had been nicknamed the Alamo long before, since it would be the site of the last stand. He picked up his weapon and ran. One magazine left, time to make every shot count. 
 
 Terrified children bawled and screamed. The only thing that nagged at him. They should n't be here. Not on this day. The civilians, or so they were called, now clutched their own weapons. This was humanity's last stand, and defeat was a fore gone conclusion. 
 
 The clash of arms from the upper levels finally ended, which only meant one thing. They were next. 
 
 `` Get ready!'' he shouted, and those around him steeled themselves the best that they could. 
 
 The first of the invaders charged in, and were felled by well-aimed rifle fire. But the tide did n't slow, and more charged onwards. Marc's M57 ejected the spent magazine, and he tossed the useless rifle aside, and pulled out his combat knife. He ran through the enemy fire, charging for the closest enemy warrior he could see. 
 
 With a swift move though, his opponent ducked and slapped the small blade from Marc's hand. The enemy warrior grabbed Corporal Sanders by the neck, and lifted him, raising him to head level. Marc's final act before losing consciousness was to raise his right hand. 
 
 And with incredible effort, he extended his middle finger.

113816,"[ WP ] After lights out at Home Depot , the wild dads come out to play
","Rich waited patiently hidden among the neatly stacked bags of mulch as the cashier locked the final door on his way out. Making sure that all was clear, Rich signaled his party to emerge from their concealed position. Slowly they all crept forward into the lawn care section, each companion holding their preferred weapon. Some brandished sharpened shovels, others re-purposed garden shears. Rich himself fancied a a combination of a hatchet and a DeWalt hammer. 
 
 Rich and his companions, all once proud fathers, had given up their lives with their wives, children, and friends. The allure of endless power tools and DIY supplies was far too great. The only thing that mattered now was a dispute with a rival tribe of dads over browsing rights in isle 4. Rich knew that his companions believed that the Black and Decker selection was a hoard of treasure worth dying for. 
 
 As the party approached the agreed-upon location, between the toolboxes, power drills, and the occasional lawnmower, they spotted their foe. An equal number of feral middle-aged men waited to greet them. Rich spotted Dale, his bitter enemy. Rich, being the elected leader of his band, stepped forward. 
 
 `` I challenge you,'' he announced in his stentorian voice, `` in order to seek justice for injustices done upon our people - to a trial by combat!'' 
 
 Dale scratched at his head, adjusting his combover as to better hide his receding hairline. 
 
 `` This isle is not yours!'' He quipped, `` all of us should have equal access to these great halls. Who are you to decide which of us rules this store?'' Dale revved up his weapon of choice: a hedge trimmer that Rich was all too familiar with. He had lost many men to it's fearsome blades. 
 
 `` We will find out which one of us is right soon enough.'' Rich replied through clenched teeth. 
 
 With remarks exchanged, both Rich and Dale's companions formed the ritual circle. They began to chant ominously as Rich and Dale circled each other. Rich tried to stay focused. He kept his gaze on the buzzing blades of his foe's weapon. One touch would be enough. Dale suddenly lashed out in a fury. Rich sidestepped with great effort as the deadly trimmer cut through the air where he was standing moments before. Again the whirring power tool swung around, and Rich ducked under the would-be fatal blow. At this moment Rich launched a counter-blow with his hammer, but Dale deftly parried the blow. The shock of the powered-up trimmer nearly knocked the hammer out of Rich's hand, but he held firm. 
 
 Unfazed, Rich began to mount an offensive. He needed to be cautious of the reach of Dale's weapon, but Rich had two weapons, so Dale needed to split his attention. Rich swung from many angles at once, forcing Dale to both dodge blows and parry at the same time if he wished to survive. It seemed as if these two embittered rivals would fight forever. They were both panting, sweaty, and weary from battle. 
 
 In his physically drained fury, Rich lashed out with his hammer, but Dale saw the predictable blow coming and batted it aside, knocking the hammer out of Rich's hand. A swift kick to the stomach knocked Rich sprawling onto the ground. Cheers of victory erupted from Dale's retinue. Dale himself triumphantly strode forward until he was on top of Rich. Rich glanced to his left, and saw the looks of horror on his companion's faces. He looked back upward as his enemy raised the trimmer for the final blow. 
 
 Time slowed down for Rich. His arm seemed to move itself, as with great speed he clenched his hatchet, rolled out of the way of his death blow and buried the weapon in Dale's shoulder. Shouts of joy mixed with cries of pain as Dale collapsed onto the ground. Rich looked knowingly at his worthy opponent. As the locked eyes, the both knew what must be done. Rich struck downward a final time, victorious at last. 
 
 Dale's retinue shambled forward to carry away their fallen champion. Rich, weary from battle, returned with his companions to their hovel underneath the store floors, repairing the entryway to conceal any trace of them as they went along. He knew that he and his tribe would need to work to survive yet again the next night, but for now, he laid down to rest.

210851,"[ WP ] A film Noir style murder mystery set in a fledgling colony on Mars .
","Carbon dioxide scrubbers would need to be replaced by the end of the week. My office air was so stagnant I drew half breaths to avoid choking. Mars has become too much like Earth. Now we have cities filled with miserable people, alleys painted with drunkard's piss and bile, and enough corpses hidden away for a private investigator to make decent cash. 
 
 Even on a terraformed planet, a clean slate if ever there was one, humans found a way to cover every inch with their filth. 
 
 I'd seen enough of what people can do to each other on Earth. Resettling in the new solar territories seemed like a good idea. Too bad I found more of the same shit I was running from waiting for me. Oxidized, red dust can be tainted just like the soil back home. So I had seen plenty of kidnappings, thefts, rapes, and murders in my new city. New Tuscany was nothing like its Italian inspiration. It was a city that had grown too fast. When a metropolis springs up that quickly, there's money to be made on the stepped toes ( and slit throats ) of business. There were rumors that the steel and concrete foundation of this city were peppered with the dumped corpses of uncooperative workers and foreman. 
 
 It's a great story for tourists, of course, but I know it's not so far removed from the truth. 
 
 My ex-husband had been an architect. Honestly, he was brilliant. His blend of American art-deco and early 21st century modernistic architecture gave New Tuscany a skyline to remember. He was a household name, despite his brooding private investigator husband. But this town is n't kind to prodigies. Somewhere along the line he made an enemy, and the city was too busy to care about one man. 
 
 I had to identify his remains. It wo n't surprise you to learn that I had an iron stomach, but my heart could bleed just like the rest of us. He had been tossed out of the city limits, where the oxygen pumps did n't reach. There's enough air outside the big cities to breathe... for about ten minutes. You start getting bubbles in your bloodstream, you start to bulge like a full tick, then you suffocate with blood pouring from your eyes and ears. When I was asked if this engorged pile of blood and ruptured skin was my husband, I sobbed out a yes and died. 
 
 This city should be buried in a sandstorm and forgotten. But life is n't fair. More husbands and wives will be thrown into forgotten pits tonight. I ca n't stop it - no one can. But I'll keep my doors open and spend sleepless nights trying to find answers for those who have been trampled. It's easy for me to say that this city is what has forsaken them, but that's a lie. There's nothing special about New Tuscany or Mars. 
 
 Now it's just filled with people, and people are always to blame.

 I was the epitome of the American Dream. While my investments yielded $ 2 trillion in interest every year, I toured the world in my personal cruise ship, sipping umbrella drinks and munching on shredded gold caviar. Every day I bought out and sunbathed on a different beach, and every night I rented out a seven star hotel. If a public official or anti-capitalist got in my way, I gave them a check for a billion dollars, and they went away. 
 
 I'm sure you've heard of the `` baby's first word principle'' - how a baby's first word defines his life. Either way, since most parents made their kids say `` Daddy'' or `` Mommy,'' the majority of my peers just grew up to be parents, nothing more. How mundane. 
 
 That was the trend. But my famous lifestyle had attracted attention, and parents of this day and age decided that `` word therapy'' was the way to go. If they wanted their kids to be like me, all they had to do was say my name. 
 
 All over the world, they whispered it into their children's ears at night instead of caressing them or cooing at them. Children's books managed to find new ways to rhyme with my name every day. The most desperate parents bought apps that repeated my name over and over again, and locked kids in a room with a speaker until they said it. 
 
 It had visible effects in the new generation, often spontaneous and unexpected ones. This generation of kids had a record high rate of obesity, and doctors were saying there was a pandemic of eating disorders worldwide. Honestly, they should have known better. My name means something very different in English, after all. But no one felt this was a result of the `` first word principle'' - it was always social media, or education, or smartphones, or the lack of health care, or fast food, or entitlement. 
 
 They have it all wrong - you do n't make your kids become like me by making them say my name. No, no, no. It does n't take a genius to realize that if you want your kids to become quadrillionaire, their first word has to be the same as mine - `` 富''. In Chinese, that means `` wealth'', or `` riches'', but not exactly - like most Chinese words, there's no English word that matches it exactly. In any case, it meant that I was destined to be where I am today. 
 
 But most of all, you should n't have made them say my name, since my Vietnamese father's family name means something rather different in English. Seriously, why would you have your kids become `` Phat?''

 kkrrrrBOOOM!!!!! 
 
 Without warning the air sizzled and cracked and let out a blast of pure energy. The figure that was left behind in the shallow crater sizzled and smoked for a few seconds before it began to stand. It turns quickly and dashes into the dense jungle. A few million years pass…. 
 
 The smell….. TIGER!!! RUNN!!!!! Almost as instantly as the call was made the trees and underbrush shook alive. Screams and howls and roars sing through the sky as the proto-humans began calling for their young and old to scatter into the thick jungle. A mad sprint up a tree trunk, leaping to the highest branches and into connected trees, the troop continuously calls out warnings of danger. One of the brave males calls for silence and begins to listen for the footfalls of the demon cat. Straining their ears and eyes to search for the movement of death, they find nothing. Stay still. Listen.... nothing. 
 
 The male calls “ all clear ” and turns to see the eyes leap from the underbrush! Before he can shout, a large figure falls from above, stabs the beast with a sharpened branch through the skull and places the carcass at the feet of the male in one swift motion. The male is in full frozen panic. The figure… hhhas… no skin. No smell. No sound. For a brief eternity they stare at each other. A sound…. A soothing, fluttering tone fills all of the ears of the family and they transfix on the skinless giant. It turns its gaze to the dead cat and pulls the spear out of the beast, and places it on the ground, and none of the family moves. It lifts the animal into the air with one arm and carefully strips the skin off with the other. The cat killer gently places the meat at the feet of the male, still standing motionless. The blood soaked cat skin is fitted to the skin-less head and attached to the shoulders. Slowly the giant raises the bloody spear and offers it to the brave patriarch. The gift is received calmly and with open arms. 
 
 A new sound, soft and gentle, clear and controlled emerged from behind the bloody cat mouth….. “ good. ” 
 
 As the sound entered the ears of the tribe, all at once, their legs could not bear the weight of all they had experienced and each of them fell to their knees. The camouflaged titan turned and leapt into the trees without a sound. The family saw it leave the ground but lost sight as their heads tilted up. Within seconds the soothing tone faded but the troop didn ’ t stand. They knew the thing had gone but none of them wanted to move. The newly knighted male began to imitate the new sound, “ aaAAHH ” …. “ kaaaHH ” …. “ oow oo ” …. “ kaaoo ”.

","Janice held her sick son Tommy close in the gray medical ward, located deep within the transport ship that was only a few days from reaching Mars. 
 
 Sweat dripped off of Tommy's red face, and Janice put a cool cloth upon his forehead in hopes that it would keep his sickness from getting worse. 
 
 It had been hours since little Tommy had been able to say anything, and Janice felt more helpless now than she had ever felt. 
 
 `` I used to live on Earth you know.'' She said softly as she moved her soft fingers through Tommy's hair. 
 
 `` Back when I was a little girl, I had no idea how good I had it. 
 
 We used to live in a small white bricked home in a place called Germany, and I lived there my whole life until the Fire Wars forced me to leave when I was sixteen. 
 
 You should have seen it Tommy. We had a big lush field to play in during the summer time, and there was a big hill in the back to sled through the thick snow during the long winter. 
 
 A skinny doctor wearing a freshly pressed white overcoat, adorned with the international medical shield, walked cautiously into the room and looked at Janice for a long time before speaking. 
 
 `` Did you need anything Mrs. Werner?'' 
 
 Janice glanced up at him and quickly replied, `` No. I'll be on my way in my own time. I know we're on a tight scedule.'' 
 
 The skinny doctor nodded and then closed the heavy gray door to the medical ward. 
 
 For a long while, Janice kept running her fingers through Tommy's black hair, and noted how closely it resembled her late husband. 
 
 Why did Tommy have to suffer her husband's fate too? 
 
 Janice continued her story. 
 
 `` Although there were many breathtaking places on Earth, there was one place that I would n't trade for anything... except for... well...'' a small tear ran down her cheek. 
 
 `` It was the dining room window that looked over our big front yard. 
 
 From there you could see the seemingly endless green fields, and all of our flowers. 
 
 On a cold rainy day, I would sit at the table, and watch the heavy rain cover the world. 
 
 I was happy, because I could look out at all of this and still be perfectly warm. 
 
 My mother would bring us a big hot lunch, and we would all gather around and talk about our day. 
 
 I know it does n't sound like much, but to me this was paradise. 
 
 I hope that heaven is a little bit like that for you.'' 
 
 The thin doctor opened the door again and walked over to Janice. 
 
 `` Let's get you some dinner. You need to have some food with your medicine Mrs. Werner.'' 
 
 She reluctantly agreed and laid Tommy softly on the bed to tuck him in just the way he liked. 
 
 As Janice waited in the cafeteria line for her dinner, the skinny doctor met with the nurse and told her, `` Mrs. Werner's delusions have been increasing. We might need to send her to the facility across town.''

","I know what it's really like, down there. Down there in the dirt and and mud and slime, where people are n't people but have become something altogether unrecognisable. Those things are n't people any longer; evolution has helped them to survive, and in doing so has made them abhorrent. We're not told much about them, up here, but I know. I've been down there. I've seen it. The higher ups make sure to try not to scare us. But people are n't stupid; they've heard enough rumours, they've seen the pictures, videos. Heard tales of children wandering down sewage lines, making their way down into the depths where creatures we would n't recognise as human find them, and take them. Every so often you hear a story, and all of us sorry cowards up here are n't capable of courage when faced with the horrifying prospect of what lies below. 
 
 Everything changed when I saw her transport plummet. She was on her way to school; a transport full of school kids picked her up from our door, as it did every morning, and set off into the air from our island to the next. It was a stupid thing, really. We rely on transport ships to traverse those distances above the trenches so often, we take them for granted. We take the risk for granted. I watched my girl, as she waved to me from the back window of that damned machine, and I watched as it took and spluttered for a moment, over that abyss, and as it's exhausts suddenly spluttered black smoke and it began it's viscous descent toward the ground. All I could do was watch, and I vaguely recall vomiting, and my wife on the ground with her head in her hands and she was shrieking, and there at that moment I felt so helpless I thought I might suffocate from the pain of it. 
 
'I'm so sorry, Sol. I'm so, so sorry. It was a tragic accident. But you know we ca n't authorise you to go down there. We do n't have close to that kind of authority'. I remember at that moment, I could have flung the Sergeant down into those depths himself, if he was n't such a fat fuck. I tried to appeal to him,'Jai is down there, right now. A ship full of school children is down there right now. How can we do nothing? How can you even suggest that we do nothing for fucks sake? Give me the okay, give me confirmation to take a transport down there! It's my daughter, Don. Jai is down there right now, probably scared shitless, and I have to go to her. I have to bring her back, her and the other kids. Those things down there; they ca n't find her first, Don. They just ca n't. We have to go and bring the kids back. I need my daughter back'. I remember looking at Don and my vision warbling and feeling like I might explode from inaction. The Sergeant looked at me, and I knew what he was going to say by the look on his red face before his mouth even began to move,'I'm sorry, but we ca n't. We ca n't risk contamination, you know that. You know that. I'm so sorry, Jon.' I'm sure he was. Were n't we all. 
 
 I think he knew I could n't stop there. He revoked my badge but asked me to hand my weapon in within a week; that was a strange and unconventional action to take in his position. I knew that. I appreciated it, even though he we would n't help me with transports, even in light of my position. I'm not sure I could ever forgive that disloyalty of an old friend. 
 
 I made my way down a waste line the same night. I slid down with the shit and piss in that cramped tube, which I managed to sneak into through the city works. That was n't so hard; security was tight, but not tight enough to stop somebody determined. After all, no right minded person would make their way down to the ground and assume they were ever coming back again. Nobody ever had. Those guards at the works were on a glorified suicide watch. 
 
 I remember hitting the ground. I was terrified; terrified for Jai, but not so much so that I did n't still have some concern for myself. In honesty I was scared shitless. You see, living up here, in the light, we are told from being children about the horrors of the ones on the ground. Legends of lanky, hairless creatures with slender limbs and black eyes. I know, they're worse than we imagine. I had heard enough to know that light might be my best hope down there. I clambered free of the sewage pipe and found myself in darkness; I could sense brush around me, and vaguely make out tall, spindly trees with branches that reached upwards, blocking all sunlight and looking like emaciated beggars with their hands in the air. I could feel the moist, muddy ground underfoot. I flicked out my torch and compass, and headed due North, toward where I had figured Jai and the kids had crash landed. I was n't so worried about them being dead from the crash; those transport ships were designed to survive collisions such as those. What nobody is prepared for, however, are the things down there. I certainly was n't. I set off quietly through the foliage, holding my breath and shining my torch into the black under brush.

 `` You- What?'' `` Call me God. Everyone else does.'' 
 
 The gas station attendant rubbed his eyes. `` Come on, man, it's late and I really do n't have time for crazy today.'' `` I'm- I'm sorry. Odd parents. Thought about changing the name to Geoffery, but eh-'' `` Right.'' The attendant sighed, returning to his Invincible comic book. The odd man on the other side of the counter rubbed his thin beard and made his way down an aisle to inspect a bag of corn chips. 
 
 Outside, a man removed a 9mm handgun from his jacket and rubbed his face with a swipe of his hand. A deep breath, and he stepped out of his truck, making his way into the lobby. The gun was pointed at the attendant's face. `` Money or you die.'' `` Hey- We do n't have much- Just-'' The clerk raised his hands. `` I do n't care. Put the money in a plastic sack and hand it over-'' 
 
 Godfrey Smith hummed the tune to Norman Greenbaum's `` Spirit in the Sky'' before returning to the counter, placing a bag of Muncho's for the clerk, who stared at him in shock, then turned his attention to the gunman. `` Hey- Hey!'' The robber raised his gun, shoving it at Smith's temple. `` Get in the fucking back or I'll blow your fucking head open, are you daft?!'' 
 
 Time seems to slow to a stop. A coffee machine in the process of brewing is stuck in a perpetual drip, a rolling series of hot dogs remain still. 
 
 `` If you shoot me now, Maria and your unborn child will be forced to live a life without you.'' The man turned, making eye contact. `` Th- The fuck? How do you know- What do you mean, unborn child?'' `` A girl. You're desperate for money, I can understand that, but you do n't need to shoot this man in a panic in fifteen seconds. You can leave now.'' 
 The man opened the bag and took a chip out, throwing it between his molars. 
 
 Time sped back into place. 
 The gunman shook his head in confusion, lowering his gun for a moment. The clerk took this moment to reach below the counter- The gunman raised his gun and curled his finger around the trigger- And stopped. `` I-.. I'm sorry.'' He ran off to the van in the parking lot and jumped into the driver's seat. 
 
 `` What the fuck- What the fuck..'' He rubbed his face again, looking over a small ziplock bag of blue-hued crystalline illicit substance in the cupholder. He punched the car into reverse and sped away, trying to collect his thoughts. Twenty minutes later, he pulled to the side of the road and stepped out to catch his breath- And Godfrey Smith was leaning against the side of the vehicle. `` Angel, why do you do this to yourself? You could have stayed in school, could have gotten your engineering degree-'' Angel turned, aiming his gun- At nobody. 
 
 `` Fu- Fuck you, man! I - Get the fuck away from me!'' 
 `` I ca n't do that, Angel. I ca n't. That baby you're going to have is destined for great things, and so are you. You ca n't throw your life away with drugs and running around.'' The man stated from Angel's side. The gunman turned, aiming his gun again. `` GO FUCK YOURSELF!'' He put a round into the man's chest. The bullet passed through, smashing into a nearby tree. 
 
 `` I've heard that so many times in far more unclear terms.'' Godfrey Smith adjusted his tie and gave the man a disappointed frown. `` What was it? Your older brother? The gang you ran with in high school? The meth addiction? You do n't have any priors- You can work and get the ball rolling again. You do n't need to rob gas stations and throw your life away with so much to lose.'' `` How do you know all of this?!'' Angel screamed, throwing his gun at the man's feet.

60886,"[ MP ] Symphony No . 5
","I sat in the very back pew. Usually I sat at the front, close enough to watch every instrument, but today, I wanted to hide. I wanted anonymity, I wanted to be unquestioned in my mourning. I wanted no one to stare at me, to wonder who the woman in black was. I wanted to be surrounded in blue, in silver, in red, to feel myself lifted to somewhere else, somewhere that was n't black. Somewhere where the grey unceasing rain was background noise, not an endless dirge. Somewhere without colourless flowers. Somewhere without graves. Somewhere where no one would say sorry. Somewhere where the crushing numbness would be lifted. 
 
 The black that had protected me like a suit of armour for the first painful days was beginning to feel like a curse. The clothes that said'I am among you, but not with you', the clothes that set me apart, made me something else, a mourner, a member of the protected class of people missing pieces of themselves, were becoming a prison of separation. Walking here, in the rain, with the tell-tale band of black on my arm, I was separate. I was among the world, walking though it, touching it, feeling it, tasting it, but I was not part of it. Here, it was different. Here, I was a part of this world. I could be in it. 
 
 The conductor raised her baton. And silence fell. There had been many silences these past weeks. The hours after the funeral had been silent, as had the days that followed. The memorial had included a minute's silence, where black-clad heads bowed in a silence so thick it filled my lungs. I had been drowning in heavy, meaningful silences. But this one was different. It did n't fill my lungs. It was n't an ending, it was a beginning.

148609,"[ WP ] A comedian dies on stage and chooses to challenge death to a stand up comedy `` laugh-off '' in exchange for his/her life .
","`` I've always wanted to laugh in the face of Death'' he forced out. If he did n't know any better he was full of confidence. He once burped, peed, and farted when his puppy George jumped on his bed in the middle of the night. Burping was n't normally something one did when scared but it seemed to add to the embarrassment. In either case, he was doing a good job pretending he was cool with the fact he just kicked the bucket and was speaking to a god. 
 
 `` I know every joke you've ever told, Human. Much like this encounter, I know how they all end.'' 
 
 He once begrudgingly signed up for a UCB Improv class. * $ 400 to learn how to say `` yes and''? Give me a break. * But it was the popular thing to do and he had already done the juice cleanse and the yoga class and this was just next on the list of `` what's IN at the moment''. He was awful. It was either `` No and...'' or `` Yes or...'' But staring Death in the face -- or at least the cold black hole where a face might typically be -- it's not like he had many other options. He was going to improv his way out of this. And by `` improv'' he meant come up with something on the spot -- a verb he incessantly worked into his daily vocabulary, much to the delight of his friends. 
 
 `` Knock knock'' 
 
 Silence. 
 
 Well. That was literally the first thing that popped into his head. $ 400 wasted. 
 
 `` Just kidding. I mean not that that's the joke, I'm just being friendly. There's usually someone to warm up the audience, ya know?'' 
 
 Here he was, a comedian without a joke. Well, could you call him a comedian? Are you a musician if you wash and fold clothes and strum a guitar during lunch break? Are you a fireman if you bus tables during the day and douse fires in your spare time? Here he was, a `` comedian'' who literally could n't tell a joke to save his life. 
 
 `` I... I...'' People do n't typically have a good view on the process of death, but it was n't dying that so deeply saddened him in that moment. It was taking stock of his life. Had he fooled himself? Had he not tried enough? Could he have done this? Should he have done that? Retelling the same bad jokes before going home to a bowl of ramen, a bowl of weed, and playing Mario Kart 64. Was that his dream? 
 
 Death could see the depression. It tasted it's salty-sweet flavor. 
 
 He looked up at the cold black hole and said, more to himself than to Death, `` I guess my whole life's been a joke''. 
 
 Death smiled a non-existent smile... and then chuckled. That chuckle became a laugh. A laugh that rose and echoed in the vast emptiness that Death inhabited. 
 
 And then it stopped. 
 
 Death finally spoke. `` Very well.'' 
 
 He stood there, looking like an idiot, while 50 people squirmed uncomfortably in their seats. The microphone felt heavier than normal in his hand. Maybe it was time to hit the gym. Eh... one new leaf at a time. `` Have you ever told a joke so bad that you black out, have a conversation with Death and then come to?'' A couple chuckles came from the back row. It was a start.

67806,"[ WP ] For sale : Baby shoes . Never worn .
","
 
 I browsed Craigslist for a cradle for the baby. I saw a variety of things: worn out night toys, half eaten maracas, old clothing that kids grew out of. I remember the five different sets of the same clothing I got for the unborn boy. Jen was absolutely sick of me getting baby clothes. Dammit Chelle, I think you want to drown the kid in clothing. She said once to me. We laughed about it. But I want this. My mom was never around. Dad did his best raising me but I think growing up I needed two parental figures. 
 
 I hit the clothing section and browsed it. One more clothing set couldn ’ t hurt. My mouse wheel chirps after browsing through hundreds of listings. One thing catches my eye though, For Sale, Babies Shoes: Never Worn. I laugh. Were the shoes so shitty that the baby cried after they put it on? I hit the link, curiosity piqued by the five dollar label. The link opens and I don ’ t know know what I was expecting… 
 
 “ Hi, my wife has been crying for the past few months and keeps looking at all the things the baby never got to wear. This stuff is in excellent condition, please take them off our hands. It hurts too much to have reminders…. ” 
 
 I breathed in. I didn ’ t need to see that. Why couldn ’ t I have just stayed on the section for cradles? My heart knocked on my ears. I closed the computer, take my now lukewarm coffee and recited a minor heat spell. Steam wafted out of the cup, the wind through the window seeing to it. The birds were screaming at each other outside. The dogs were yelling at me, mocking me for daring to look for more clothing. Maybe dad was right; the world is pretty cruel. The Fire God doesn ’ t really care about all this. He just wants ambition. 
 
 “ Michelle, can you help me out for a moment? ” Jen called out from the other room. Full name. Shit. 
 
 “ What ’ s wrong? ” I laughed a little to dispel any worry building inside. I exit my room. 
 
 “ Please don ’ t freak out. ” She begged. Double shit. I ’ m in the hallway. 
 
 “ Pshhhh, why would I freak out? ” I laughed louder this time. I ’ m in the kitchen. 
 
 “ The water broke. ” She said. I nodded fifty times. Fluid dripped own her leg. 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry, what? ” My head snapped between her eyes and her thighs. The next several moments include her lying down on the bed as she begins to breathe heavily. Our neighbor is a doctor so he stared straight into her vagina as he encourages her. Hey buddy, looking at that is my job. I shook my head. He ’ s a doctor, don ’ t get jealous Chelle… 
 
 After several moments, the baby is born, but he isn ’ t crying. Why isn ’ t he crying? 
 
 “ No heartbeat! ” He screamed out. Oh no. Please. “ Stay with me little buddy. ” He ’ s performing CPR. No use. Oh god no. He ’ s not breathing. He tried to perform a healing water spell. No use. 
 
 I raised my hand. I began chanting a healing flame spell. No use. Again. No use. Again! No use. AGAIN! No use. Please… I don ’ t want to lose him… 
 
 “ PLEASE! ” I screamed out. I readied the spell again when my sense are snatched away. An old man with an auburn beard rested his chin on a mahogany staff. He sat on a white throne staring at me. The Fire Vessel. Why am I here? 
 
 “ Shhhhh. Quiet young Michelle. Calm is key for what is about to transpire. ” He raised his hand. 
 
 “ My kid is about to die. Calm is the last thing I need right now! ” I yelled. How dare he tell me to calm down! 
 
 “ You would have perished if you had continued. You ’ ve depleted all of your mana. ” The Fire Vessel waved his hand, images of my skin cracking and embers falling off my skin surrounded me. 
 
 “ I… ” 
 
 “ We don ’ t have much time child. This body is failing me and I believe we can come to a mutual agreement. ” He raised his staff and hit the base into the ground. The room transformed into the Fire Altar. 
 
 “ You want me to… ” I cupped my mouth. A Vessel Deity. He wants me to become the conduit in which the Fire God interacts with the human world. It meant an eternity of loyalty towards him. 
 
 “ No, I want you to articulate the intensity of your desire. I value ambition. I value desire. What do you want more than anything in the world? ” He held out his hand. 
 
 “ I want to save my child. I want to give him what I never received. I want him to be loved so dearly and so preciously that he never has to wonder if his mothers love him. ” I take his hand, the Fire flows into me, transforming me. 
 
 It is done Michelle. We are one. Wake up, your child will live. The Fire spoke within my own mind. With the knowledge of a God flowing through my mind, I return to my child. I cast The Flame of Affinity. Fire has now marked him, he can no longer choose for himself the elements. Wind, Water and Earth are forever locked. 
 
 He begins to cry. He ’ ll live. Jennifer looks at me with fear. The doctor comes to me and asks me a simple question. 
 
 “ What ’ s his name? ” 
 
 “ Alex. ”

 `` I have something I need to tell you, Gavin'' said Ron, calmly. 
 
 `` Your mother and your father have past away in an accident coming home early hours of the morning. I was told to tell you they love you very much Gavin, please do not be sad.'' 
 
 `` How did they die'' replied Gavin, tears swelling in his eyes. 
 
 `` Like I said, it was during an acc-'' 
 
 `` Do not bullshit me, Ron! I am 19 I know when you are lying to me'' 
 
 Ron sat back in his armchair and took a long drag of his pipe. 
 
 `` Your father was drunk, your mother was in the passenger seat and he crashed the car off the mountain pass. They are recovering the wreckage as we speak, that is the truth.'' 
 
 Gavin closed his eyes, so not to burst into tears. 
 
 `` I knew he was a drunk, I knew this would happen one day Ron. Remember me telling you?'' 
 
 `` I do, son. I do'' 
 
 Ron embraced Gavin for a solid 5 minutes. 
 
 `` It is alright lad, I will be here to take care of you, you can stay at mine as long as you like.'' 
 
 `` Thank you Ron, I think I'll take you up on that offer.'' 
 
 Ron nodded slightly with a faded smile. Gavin stood up from his chair and looked out he window. 
 
 `` I am going to head up to bed, I'll come over yours tomorrow if that's okay Ron?'' 
 
 `` That is fine boy, but you need to know this, a lot of responsibility is going to fall on you now, a lot more than you have ever faced. Do you understand me?'' 
 
 Gavin gave a defeated look. 
 
 `` I do n't have the right frame of mind to understand anything and I feel rather sick honestly, I'll speak to you tomorrow.'' 
 
 Ron nodded once more as Gavin left the room. 
 
 `` I'm afraid tomorrow will be too late, young boy'' Ron said to himself, under his breath. 
 
 Gavin did not sleep the whole night, instead he tossed and turned and threw up multiple times until he passed out around 7 am. 
 
 Ron came back to Gavin's house around 4 pm to see if he was alright, the lights were still off inside the house, so Ron assumed Gavin was still asleep. 
 
 Ron knocked the door 4 times. 
 
 `` Gavin? Are you still asleep? I brought you some food and resources to keep you going through the day, you need to eat'' 
 
 `` LEAVE ME RON!'' came the muffled scream from within the house. 
 
 Ron took a step back. 
 
 `` It has begun! So early'' Ron said to himself. 
 
 `` Let me in Gavin, I know what is happening to you!'' Ron replied, banging his walking stick on the door. 
 
 Smashes could be heard from within, things being knocked over and fabrics being torn, like clothing. 
 
 With an almighty swing, Ron smashes the lounge window, and clambers inside. He can hear a culmination of crying, screaming and torment. And he knew exactly what was going on. Ron turned the corner into the kitchen and in the corner, on the floor on his hands and knees is Gavin, retching and arching his back in pain. 
 
 `` STAY AWAY FROM ME RON!'' Gavin cried out. 
 
 `` Listen to me boy, you are developing... yourself. You need to let it happen!'' replied Ron, awkwardly. 
 
 `` WHAT DO YOU MEAN LET IT HAP -- ARRHH!'' Gavin screamed out in pain as the sound of bones cracking in his back became audible. 
 
 `` You are already 7 steps in, 2 more to go and it'll end I promise you, hold in there Gavin'' replied Ron, anxiously. 
 
 Gavin screamed out in panic and pain as two more cracks began, he suddenly stops. 
 
 `` I am bleeding, my back... it's ble-AHHHHHH!!!'' Gavin screams out for a final time as 2 beautiful white wings flourish from his shoulder blades and take up a large portion of the kitchen. 
 
 `` You did it Gavin!'' Ron said happily. 
 
 `` WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING TO ME, EXPLAIN RON NOW!'' exclaimed Gavin. 
 
 `` Your mother was n't ordinary, she was an angel known as `` The Crebuli'', an ancient race of angel that protect the planets within our solar system, your mother protected Earth Gavin, she married your father, who is human and made you, a half-angel.'' 
 
 `` THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE, YOU ARE HER FATHER!'' Gavin cried out, angrily. 
 
 `` No Gavin, I am sorry, but that was a cover up for you and her husband. I am known as a decoy. I was sent alongside your mother to act as an alibi and to also make sure you had a successful passing, which you have done so yourself. You are a new protector of Earth.'' 
 
 Gavins panting begins to slow, he is calming. 
 
 `` A protector of Earth? I do n't know what I am doing and I am not strong enough to protect the earth.'' Gavin replies, yet again defeated. 
 
 `` It'll all come in due time Gavin, you will gain strength rapidly over the next week, let your body heal and you will be ready for training. But first, learn to encase your wings so nobody sees them in public, otherwise the jig is up and the 10 o clock news is banging on your door.'' 
 
 `` Right, how do I do that exactly?'' replied Gavin, quizzically. 
 
 `` Easy, imagine them as another limb, you must learn to control them and harness them, you will do the same with your other powers too'' 
 
 `` POWERS!'' Gavin exclaimed excitingly. 
 
 `` ONLY to be used for good and when necessary Gavin...'' 
 
 Gavin slowly arose to his feet, his wings spread out, knocking things off the counter. Gavin closed his eyes and breathed deeply and slowly. 
 
 `` A new limb, I got this'' Gavin said to himself. 
 
 Slowly the wings began to retract back into Gavin's spine. Gavin opened his eyes and smiled at Ron, who smiled back. 
 
 `` You got i...'' Ron's face turned white and his expression became null, he dropped to the floor like a bag of bricks. Gavin ran to his side. 
 
 `` Ron! Ron what is happening to you!'' 
 
 `` Once a decoy's job is complete, we die. You must learn the rest for yourself now boy, I know you can do it'' Ron replied in a wheezy, faint voice. 
 
 `` No you can not die, I need you now more than ever!'' Gavin replied tears beginning to well in his eyes. 
 
 `` You will do fine my boy, just keep those wings out of trouble and the rest will come naturally, this is your calling boy, do not waste it'' 
 
 `` How do I know where to begin?'' Replied Gavin, finally coming to terms with Ron's demise. 
 
 `` All the secrets will unlock to you, Raziel. Now go, be amazing'' and with that, the twinkle in Ron's eye went out. 
 
 Gavin slowly stood and walked calmly to the back door. 
 
 `` Raziel? Is that my name?'' 
 
 Gavin slowly opened the back door and walked to the center of his garden. He breathed a huge breath and sighed a huge sigh, before going into a crouching position, his wings un-folding and spreading. 
 
 `` I'm going to be amazing for you Ron, and for you mum'' 
 
 And with that, Gavin shot into the air at a blinding speed and took off into the sunset as Raziel, the archangel of secrets, and newest protector of Earth. 
 
 The End.

262644,"[ EU ] Tell the tale of Vault 69 , which had 999 women and one man . Alternatively , tell the tale of Vault 68 , which had 999 men and one woman .
","The vault was made to house about 1050 families of three to four. Supposedly Vault-Tec had planned this out using some mathematical assumption about actual entrance to the vault compared to what the registered number of inhabitants would be. What that meant in the early years is that every woman had a full small home to herself. The mess hall tended to have an interesting variety of chef changes every few weeks. We had a few women learning to cook, and some others learning new skills. The population was pretty balanced out in terms of needed skill sets for survival, though we lacked that many in security, or some of the more labor intensive kinds of handy-work at first. That was about twenty-three years ago however. 
 
 Now here we are, just about every woman who came into the vault when the bombs fell ended up pregnant at some point or another in those first six years. About 90 % of the population was able to give birth to children, there were some who did n't survive childbirth, or other accidents, and some who just could n't have children. But for the most part everything went as expected besides the fact that none of us ever had a half-brother. Honestly it seems like a relief to not have to worry about children to most of us, especially given how creepy it would be after school focused so much on the dangers of inbreeding. 
 
 Our mothers still think it is weird that everyone our age is a half-sister, and there were about a thousand of them to try to keep track of. I think Jenny whose mother is the overseer now is the only one who can remember every sibling's name. But that's not the part that's most awkward about this whole thing. 
 
 The part that's awkward is that there are a growing number of us wanting to get into relationships. Most of us have never seen a real man before, and those who have only saw our father when he was alive. Sure there are photos, some movies, and the audio logs we listen to for class voiced by men, but it does n't do much for most of us. A lot of us do n't mind that they're our half sisters given what some of us assume was going to happen if we had a half brother... or worse our father had n't died six years into living in this vault. 
 
 Our mothers do however. I ca n't understand how every woman who came into the vault was a devout Christian, and that each one of them felt that it was alright to ignore the need for marriage given their needs and circumstances, but still are such big homophobes. We grew up where the only relationships that exist were with other girls, is it any wonder so many of us are considering what that means for any chance at a romantic relationship?

After a daffy and wearisome drive we arrived at the watchman campground in Zion and the sun was just beginning to sink; we had arrived at the height of the characteristic winsomeness of the Canyon. The notion of sunset in Zion Canyon is particularly enlightening to the unconversant person as the arrayal is chastely unequivocally extraterrestrial in nature. The contrast in lighting created by the high rocks and its effect is stunning as parcels of rock and forest are filled in with hues of red and green, a most undoubtedly unparalleled display of nature ’ s ability to awe. The genuinely admirable part of the canyons ostentation can be attributed to the sky as the singularly pulchritudinous display would be nothing if it wasn ’ t for its vertical counterpart whose clouds induce a divine haze that are seemingly advantageous in a quest towards unitive knowledge when dichotomized with the canyon.

","Gordon raised his mighty finger, and slammed it upon the metal. 
 
 With a violent cry, he sent thousands soaring; bodies slammed into the thick, black walls behind them, coating them in blood. Many flew to the glass, near shattering it, and even more were slaughtered instantly from the impact of his wondrous power. Vultures stormed through windows, swooping in from the night sky to feast upon the corpses of his slain foes. 
 
 `` I am Gordon, King of all. Bow before your master.'' 
 
 Suddenly, a thunderous stomp was heard behind him. *Someone approaches. * He spun round and stared at the stairs behind his noble throne. *Could it be an ogre? Or a troll? Perhaps a worthier challenger? * 
 
 A foot wearing pink appeared. Then a thick, hairy leg. The bottom of a tunic of green, with lightly coloured roses, and suddenly Gordon realized. *The Roses, * he thought, *The sigil of the mighty one, the harbinger of my demise... This is no troll. This is much worse. * 
 
 The beast descended the last step, and he gazed upon the face of his vanquisher. Slowly, and frightened beyond all hope, his grip upon his weapon released, and there was a clang as his xbox controller struck the carpet with a *crash*. 
 
 The beast opened it's mouth, and spoke. `` Gordon, would you and your little friends like some Macaroni and cheese?''

63924,"[ WP ] Jordan just learned how to stop time with his powers . Too bad he did n't know how to restart it .
","One thing Jordan hated more than anything was when people were late. Sighing, he looked at the clock for what had to be the hundredth time, only to find it had stopped. Great time for the batteries to die. As he stood he took his phone out of his pocket. For a long time all he could do was stare at the screen wondering when, how, what had happened, because it was telling exactly the same time as the clock… and it had stopped too. Slowly, not certain he wanted to know what was outside, he went to the door, hoping he was imagining things. Maybe he ’ d got so bored waiting he ’ d fallen asleep. Biting hard on his lip he opened the door. The plumber, who Jordan had believed was late, was standing on the doorstep, his hand outstretched, as though he was about to ring the doorbell. 
 
 Carefully, not certain if things would change if he touched the plumber, Jordan eased his way around the man, torn between panic and fascination. Something, or someone, had stopped time. It was entirely possible he was the one who ’ d done it, as he was the only one who didn ’ t seem affected by whatever it was. If it was him he had no idea how to fix it. He had no idea how he ’ d done it in the first place, so fixing it would be impossible, which was something he wasn ’ t going to think about. The last thing he wanted was for the sudden terror he felt to get the better of him. Time would go back to normal. It had to. There was no possibility of things staying the way they were. Or at least that was the hope he was going to cling onto while he slowly walked up the street. 
 
 Everyone who had been walking up the street was frozen. Mrs Wilkins had her three dogs with her, and they were all frozen as well. He walked over to them, knowing he didn ’ t have to worry about them attacking him if he woke them up when he touched them, and stroked Buttons ’ back. Nothing happened. Buttons stayed where she was, frozen in time. Shaking his head Jordan made his way back to his house, not certain what else he should do. As he brushed past the plumber he couldn ’ t help hoping it would fix things, but it didn ’ t, and he had no idea what he should do next. Did he try to fix things by trial and error? What happened if he made everything worse? Was there anything worse? 
 
 Jordan sat back where he had been when he was waiting for the plumber and tried to imagine everything going back to normal. In his vision everyone started moving again. Seconds later someone knocked on the door. Breathing a sigh of relief he went to answer it, but it wasn ’ t the plumber who ’ d knocked. Instead there was a girl there, who looked as panicked as he felt. “ I was beginning to think I was the only one. ” She blinked, as though she was trying to stop herself from crying. “ I ’ m Laura. ”

150466,"[ WP ] The clairvoyant actually manages to see how your beloved grandmother is doing in the afterlife . Apparently she 's in hell , and it appears she 's taken over .
","Her hands were soft. I tried to focus on that: manicured fingernails, a sizable diamond engagement ring— 
 
 I winced as her face blurred again, shadows crisscrossing her eyes. 
 
 `` Is everything okay?'' I heard her voice faintly. It was miles away and the darkness— 
 
 I let go of her hands, my heart pounding. `` Can we'' —I cleared my throat—'' try the bracelet?'' 
 
 `` Of course.'' Livia dug around in her designer purse, pulled out a silver box, and opened it with a soft *click*. A pearl bracelet sat inside. She gingerly lifted it up and passed it to me. 
 
 One touch and sparks jumped through my fingers. I drew back, shaking my hand. 
 
 `` I just want to know how she is.'' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' I let out an exasperated breath. `` Sorry, ma'am, I'm working on it.'' Gently, I wrapped my fingers around the pearls, ignoring the electric pain shooting through my spine. `` Why do n't you— God.'' My head was spinning. `` Sorry. Could you tell me a little about your grandma, then?'' 
 
 The woman was holding a blood soaked tissue. I blinked, and it cleared into a Kleenex. `` She was just such a wonderful lady. Brilliant, too, always telling the most whimsical stories of her home back in Italy.'' 
 
 `` Italy,'' I whispered, my voice scratchy. `` Nice.'' The walls trembled before falling into dust around me as the ceiling was swept into oblivion. Shadowy hands reached out, brushing my ankles, and flames licked my hair. 
 
 Then it was gone. My chair was shoved back from the table, the bracelet on the floor. `` This is quite a show,'' the woman said, checking her delicate wristwatch, `` but I— `` 
 
 `` Your grandma's in Hell.'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` What?'' I cleared my throat. `` Italy. Did she by chance live near a vineyard?'' 
 
 Her forehead furrowed. `` Yes, she did. She visited it as a little girl.'' 
 
 Lucky guess. I grabbed the bracelet and the world fell away screaming. Shrieks came from the cracks in the earth, and a rippling figure emerged from the blackness. 
 
 It was a thin old lady, a cashmere coat hanging on her shoulders. Black sunglasses were perched on her prominent nose, swallowing up her small face. Her skin was a surprisingly unwrinkled tan; her grey hair was pulled into a wispy bun. 
 
 A cigarette dangled between her fingers, and she brought it to her bright red lips before beckoning me forward. 
 
 I walked towards her cautiously, looking over my shoulder, then at my surroundings. 
 
 The old lady gave me a disapproving look. `` Livia sent you, no?'' 
 
 `` Yes ma'am.'' 
 
 `` Tell that dumb *puttana* to stay out my money. I never liked her or her *coglione* husband.'' She waved her hand and I fell sideways off the edge of Hell. 
 
 I gasped, back in the room. 
 
 `` Did you see her?'' Livia questioned anxiously. `` My dear grandmother?'' 
 
 `` She called you a bitch.'' 
 
 `` *Excuse* me?'' 
 
 `` Huh? She was very rich. She said *rich*.'' 
 
 An arched eyebrow lifted. `` Did she?'' 
 
 `` Livia,'' I said gently. `` I know this is very hard for you.'' 
 
 `` Hard?'' 
 
 `` It's always difficult to lose someone you care about.'' 
 
 The woman nodded. `` Of course. Thank you for understanding.'' 
 
 `` Did your grandma wear cashmere?'' 
 
 `` Actually, she did have this one coat. Very nice; I— after her death, well, we never could find it.'' 
 
 `` Was it resistant to fire?'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Nothing, nothing.'' I sighed, leaning back in my chair. `` What about Prada? Handbags, shoes, whatnot?'' 
 
 She gave me a curious look. `` I'm sorry, what does this have to do with— `` 
 
 `` Please. Humor me.'' 
 
 `` She had an... extensive collection, one might say.'' 
 
 I shook my head, smiling in disbelief. `` Have you ever— Ma'am, have you ever heard that the Devil wears Prada?''

","The old man picked up the tray and carried it with him. The line moved quickly, just as it had every day for the past 27 years, and the old man soon found himself at the counter. It was Tuesday, so the man put forwards his tray and said `` Beef. No cabbage. The Trifle. Orange Juice.''. He'd been here a long time, and the Tuesday menu had n't changed in all that time. The food was quickly piled on his tray, and he turned to walk to his regular seat. He got about halfway there before he felt a pain in his shoulder and a heaviness in his chest, the room began to spin around him and the tray slipped from his fingers. As he fell to the floor two guards ran up to him. 
 The bald one reached him first and knelt down beside him, checking vital signs. The tall one stood behind him, casting a wary eye over the assembled prisoners; he'd learned from experience that the cafeteria could go off like a powder keg if you were n't careful. 
 `` How is he?'' Asked the tall one. 
 `` Not good.'' replied the bald one `` Looks like a heart attack. We need to get him out of here. Fast.'' 
 The tall one nodded in agreement and helped the bald one to pick the man up. Normally they'd wait for a stretcher but events in the cafeteria had to be dealt with fast. The prisoners seemed to crowd around as they carried the old man out of the room, everyone wanting to get a look. Thankfully nothing else happened and they made it out of there without incident. A few extra guards filed into the room after they left to remind the prisoners that making a fuss would be a bad idea. 
 `` So where are we taking him then?'' Asked the tall one. `` Medical?'' 
 `` Not this one.'' Replied the bald one, a finger wresting on the old man's wrist as he carried him. `` With his age and everything I reckon it's straight to Necro for him.'' 
 
 Strictly speaking the Necromancy Department was a part of Medical, but it was placed on the other side of the complex. It used to be right next to the rest of Medical for quick access if something went wrong, but this made the prisoners uneasy so it had to be moved. So it was that the guards arrived at their destination between the storage area and Accounts, the Necromancy Department. 
 After a quick argument over who should do it, the tall one knocked on the door. 
 `` Come in'' came a light, cheery voice from within. 
 The guards shared a quick glace, and then carried their quarry through the door. 
 
 Necromancy is a delicate art which takes many years to learn, and a lifetime to master. It's a necessary part of modern life, but one which many people feel uncomfortable with. A discipline which people rely on but would rather not meet the practitioners of, much like sewage management in that way. Consequently, Necromancers tended to command a mixture of fear and respect, topped off with a dollop on unease. In the case of Mary Allard, Chief Necromancer of Wealstun Prison there was a lot of respect, a lot of fear, and a mammoth portion of unease. 
 As the guards entered she turned to look at the door. The action was done mostly as a courtesy as she wore opaque glasses, hiding the dead eyes which lay beneath, and through which she saw nothing. Instead she saw the guards through the eyes of the birds which roosted on the walls, their heads turning to follow the guards movements. 
 `` Let's see what we have here'' said Allard as she stood and walked to look at the old man; the too perfect walk of one who sees themselves from the outside. 
 She ran her hands over the man with an air of concentration. The bald one watched closely what she was doing, and got the distinct impression that if she still used her eyes, she would be closing them to focus. 
 `` Okaaay...'' she said drawing out the word. `` He's dead, looks like a heart attack. He died about a minute ago.'' She turned her face to the guards. `` You two did good to get him here so fast. You have my thanks, it'll certainly make my job easier.'' 
 The guards smiled to themselves, uneasy as they may be in her presence, they still had tremendous respect for the Necromancer, and being complimented by her was something to be proud of. 
 She gestured to the couch behind her. `` Put him on there and I'll get him back out to you as soon as I can, should n't take too long.'' 
 The guards did as she asked, then shuffled out. 
 `` Thank you Ma'm'' said the tall one as he left the room, with the bald one echoing him a second later. As the door closed they turned to each other smiled, and then went back to work with their heads held high. 
 
 Allard watched them leave from the Owl in the corridor which nobody noticed. Then she lifted up a hand which a hawk alighted on, and walked over to the corpse of the old man. 
 `` Well'' she said, seemingly to the Hawk. `` Time to get started.''

235984,"[ WP ] `` Of all the things I 've done in my life , I 'm getting sent to hell for THAT ? ''
","Dr Mehmed raged aloud, mustache tips gesticulating wildly as his rapidly reddening face spluttered in outrage. 
 
 `` Headmaster, I must protest this most irredeemable and torturous appointment. This... social gathering... is completely unacceptable for an elderly Head of Department such as myself. Perhaps Mr Astaire from Expressive Arts should be requisitioned for such a purpose, but certainly not myself.'' 
 
 The headmaster gazed at the infuriated man before him in abject shock. Dr Mehmed had never before addressed him like this, nor his predecessors, even when he had been asked to teach during wartime, with bombs falling about the school buildings. 
 
 `` My dear Dr Mehmed,'' he began, cautiously, `` I have never seen you object in such an insistent manner before. Surely you would not treat your colleague with such disrespect? And besides, you are the most qualified for this duty, even more so than our drama teachers. Your advanced certificate, as I might recall?'' 
 
 Dr Mehmed gripped the desk in from of him, knuckles transforming into a deathly pale white. `` Of all the things i've done in my life, i'm getting sent to hell for THAT? It was a miserable three years of research, done only so I could be better qualified to attend my insufferable uncle's wedding!'' 
 
 The headmaster smoothened his suit lapels, pausing before speech. `` A doctorate in creative arts just so you could dance at a wedding? My my Mehmed, I never knew that side of you. Anyway, you are doing this duty, no matter your squabbling. The students love you, you'll get on great. And you'll have a chance to wear your tuxedo again.'' 
 
 Wretched misery grew within Dr Mehmed heart. Tears began to well threateningly in his eyes, and his mustache drooped to the point of joining his long beard. `` But sir!'' he wailed, frantically. `` It... it... it's prom sir! How could you‽''

","`` I wo n't let you send her''. Samantha looked in her brother's eyes, he would all he could to stop her but he was n't their father, he would never hurt her. 
 
 `` Logan, it's my decision. It's the best thing for my family. You do n't get a vote. Now leave.'' Samantha opened the door and gestured for her brother to leave. Joe would be home soon, and she had to finish dinner. 
 
 Logan slammed the door shut. `` I have every right, she is my niece. I am her uncle, I wo n't let you sacrifice her.'' 
 
 `` Her father and her mother get to decide, not you. We won the bid, she's this year's sacrifice. You ca n't stop it. Now leave, before Joe comes home and makes you'' Samantha did n't understand why he was so upset, the child was annoying, always asking questions and breaking things. 
 
 `` This is n't over.'' Logan's eyes scared her, they did n't have the same mad look their father's did, but something about them haunted her. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 *Your own daughter? How could you Sam? After everything we went through, you'd sacrifice your child? * Logan threw the rope again, lassoing the tree stump with perfection. He'd been practicing for six months, every day since his sister and her husband had entered their youngest daughter into the draft. He did n't think they'd win the bid, but the other families had turned away once the reward went below a million. Logan punched the stump as he thought of Joe, his sister's husband. *I'm such an idiot. I trusted Samantha, but why did I trust Joe? He's the same as our father. If he'll do this, he has to be. He has been all this time. * 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 
 `` Mommy, please do n't do this, I love Lisa! Take me instead, but do n't take Lisa.'' Joe grabbed Jane by her hair and pulled her away from her sister. 
 
 Joe turned to his oldest daughter, `` It's a waste to send you, you're smart, you're going to take care of our family when you get a good job. Lisa,'' he said as he picked up the crying child `` is going to help all of us now with the money we get today. She ca n't do anything else. 
 
 `` She's only four! We do n't know what she can do!'' Jane cried as her father struck her again. 
 
 `` Let's go Samantha, lock the food away, if they went to misbehave they wo n't eat until we come back.'' 
 
 A few moments later, Joe and Samantha made their way to the edge of the village. Joe looked at the altar where they would leave Lisa. He focused on the bag next it, that contained their reward. 950,000 credits, he would never have to work again. Joe was so focused on the money, he did n't notice Logan walking towards him. 
 
 `` Give her to me.'' Logan was a few inches shorter, but to those watching, it seemed that Logan towered over Joe. 
 
 Joe took a step back and spoke, `` she's the sacrifice, you ca n't stop this, you'll be arrested and executed if you try.'' 
 
 `` I do n't want to stop this, I want her to be with someone that loves her before she's...'' Logan's eyes filled with tears. `` Just let me be the one to take her.'' 
 
 `` Let him do it, maybe we'll get lucky and the dragon will kill him too.'' Samantha saw the same mad look in her brother's eyes again. She did hope the dragon would kill him, she might never sleep again if it did n't. 
 
 Lisa hugged her uncle has he took her from her father. `` Uncle Logan! I missed you!'' The crowd went silent as a figure appeared in the distance. Logan made his way to the altar. Everything was ready. He placed Lisa on The Altar and knelt beside her. 
 
 `` It's all going to be okay, Uncle Logan is going to keep you safe. Okay?'' Lisa nodded. He squeezed her hand and reached beneath The Altar. The dragon's shadow covered them both, and Logan leapt to the side, his rope in hand. The Dragon hovered above the altar and roared. Logan watched as the dragon grabbed Lisa. He'd watched a sacrifice every year, but it was different watching this close. The Dragon seemed to be almost gentle with the child. 
 
 Logan's practice paid off. He threw his rope and lassoed the dragon's tail. As it climbed, he began to tie the other end around his waist. 
 
 `` Logan, what are you doing?! You'll get us all killed!'' Logan tightened the knot around his waist. The dragon swung its tail and Logan slammed against the ground. He looked up and met his sister's gaze. 
 
 `` I'm trying to save my niece!'' The Dragon roared. `` Her parents might not care what happens to her, but I love her and I'd rather die trying to save her than live and do nothing!'' 
 
 The dragon roared, and began to climb again with Logan in tow. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 
 `` Uncle Logan? Are you ok? `` Logan looked at his niece and hugged her. 
 
 `` I'm fine, are you ok?'' The air was thin, and he winced as he took a deep breath. His makeshift harness had bruised a rib, or broken a few. Logan looked around, they must be in the dragons nest. They were in a valley, a green field surrounded by rocks. He heard laughter and water splashing behind him. Children were playing in a small lake. Children from his village, all the children that were ever taken from the village he realized. 
 
 Logan felt a chill as a shadow, the dragon's shadow he realized, fell on them. It landed a few feet away from him and Lisa. Logan put his niece behind him. `` I do not intend to hurt the child.'' The dragon's voice was musical, a deep sound that Logan felt as much as he heard.

 `` Bitch, shut the fuck up,'' the tree said. `` I wo n't get up til you die! Mother fucker!'' 
 
 `` It hurts,'' I said, struggling to breathe. The tree had fallen on me five minutes ago, and still I was pinned under it. I thought of my scoutmaster's warnings about hiking alone. `` Please just roll off or something. Ca n't you roll?'' 
 
 `` I ca n't do shit til Jim gets here, you fuckin punk ass bitch.'' 
 
 `` Hey, tell him to shut the fuck up!'' a nearby tree, still standing, shouted. 
 
 `` I'm tryin' ta pollinate ova here!'' another yelled. 
 
 `` Really, I love trees,'' I pleaded. It was n't a lie; I'd walked hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles through forest at that point in my life. `` I do my best to take care of you.'' 
 
 `` Jim better get here soon, or I'm gun fuck you up!'' the tree on top of me said. 
 
 `` Why Jim?'' I struggled to speak, but I felt communication was necessary. `` Who is Jim?'' 
 
 `` Fuck you, bitch!'' 
 
 `` Tree is the only one who can walk,'' a tree said, who had n't spoken yet. It stood close behind me. In fact, I felt its root stabbing into my back, although its voice was the calmest I had ever heard. `` Every three hundred years the Great Tree dies, but tree knows when death is at hand. Tree chooses a successor then.'' 
 
 It was quiet for a time, and the pressure on my chest lessened. Soon, I heard the leaves rustling and I saw the bushes moving to clear a path. The Great Tree stood at least one hundred feet high, and on its trunk was carved the name Jim. The ground shook when it spoke. `` I speak for the trees,'' the Great Tree told me, `` but the trees say you a punk ass bitch. You fuckin' sprained your goddamn knee by tryin ta fuckin jump a shitty ass set of rock stairs! You broke your fuckin foot on a four foot piss hill in an inch of goddamn snow! Fuck you!'' 
 
 `` But... but I like the trees...'' I said, as the pressure on my lungs brought them to near collapse. Struggling to think of anything I could do to survive, my acceptance of death instead brought a sudden rage. `` And... you know what? Fuck trees! You all stand the fuck around while everyone fuckin chops you down, assholes! Oh wait, you do n't have fuckin assholes to shit with, you prick bitches! I killed you!

 My breathing caught up with me, and I realized the tree had rolled off. I could finally breathe, I realized, and cackled like a madman. 
 
 `` Know what?'' the Great Tree said, standing over me and blocking my sun. `` You're a fuckin' badass. Just plant two for every one you chop, hear?'' 
 
 `` Got it,'' I said, finally standing and dusting off my clothes. They stared at me as I walked toward my car at the trailhead. I've never set foot in that forest again... not without my ax.

 But nothing mattered anymore, only the winners decide right and wrong, and we either had to let ourselves be captured or try for the last try for victory. We decided to fight with what we had left, just to die with pride.

We attacked the few people they had guarding the ships, and we set them ablaze, we thought of escaping, but the smoke gave us away, and everything just ended, but they were left stray in the nowhere. At the very least, even if we had lost everything, at least we had something to be proud of, something to answer when death asks us why did we live. For once we were right.

169356,"[ WP ] In an alternate timeline , dinosaurs in the Eastern hemisphere are wiped out by the cataclysm , but those in the Americas survive the fallout . Millions of years later , a crew of European explorers land on the shore of the New World ...
","It was late night when they came ashore. 
 
 All the night had been filled with loud, booming sounds. Like the horn of Gabriel they echoed through the night and here and there massive shapes moved together in a herd. 
 
 `` So this is India?'' asked the boy. 
 
 Columbus nodded. 
 
 Somebody had been chased away from a nearby watering hole by something that made great, thundering noises. It was eating ferns, as this land had no grass; and upon seeing him it charged. They'd gotten only a brief image of it - something with a duck's bill and a vivid, blue crest streaked with black stripes and bright green rings around its dull, black cow's eyes. It recalled a massive, flightless bird of some sort; like the Ostriches that Columbus had heard about from other adventurers. 
 
 Only this thing, this massive bird-lizard, had scaly skin pebbled with little bumps and patches. And one of the men who had gone for water had faced its thick, meaty tail and been hurled through the air; all while the beast held its ground on all fours, sweeping up dust and howling its eerie howl off to the others in the night. 
 
 `` Warm here,'' the Boy said. And it was - thick, foggy heat obscured the stars, while in the light of the moon great, massive wings carried man-sized, furry creatures. The boy caught only one of them, once; a thing with a toothy maw, luminous red eyes and a furry black body the size of a man's. It was perched on all fours on the ground, like the mythical Gorillas Columbus had laughed about earlier in their journey. When it caught sight of the boy's torch, it whistled its terrible, ghostly whistle and then launched itself up; snapping a toothy maw and showing him its translucent, red wings with pulsing blood vessels inlaid. 
 
 They were all crowded about the ship, the palm trees rustling and the sounds of strange insects and stranger bird-things never ceasing in the sticky, foggy blackness. 
 
 `` Maybe we're dead,'' the boy's mother said. `` Maybe this is Hell. God is punishing us for leaving, for resisting King George.'' 
 
 Off in the distance was a whooping noise - one too close to home, if this place could truly ever be called anything like'home.' 
 
 They all turned and saw it - something a little bigger than a man, approaching. 
 
 It reeked like a dead bird, its body matted with greasy, black feathers and its eyes reflecting green against their torches and lights. 
 
 `` My God,'' somebody said. `` It's got a spear!'' 
 
 And it did. In its fully-feathered, ebon wings were a pair of three-clawed hands. The palms faced each other and could not move any other way, but it clutched a spear and held, over its back, a pouch of some kind. 
 
 A pouch, they all noticed, made of fur. Some kind of mammal. 
 
 It made a terrible whooping noise into the night, and from there came more of them. More of these thinking bird-lizards. 
 
 `` Stand down,'' said Columbus. The others backed away, letting the leader of the bird things approach. 
 
 `` What Bastard child of a Crow and a crocodile is this?'' Someone muttered. 
 
 Columbus approached the thing, holding up his hands in surrender. He was prepared for men. Indians. Not Monsters. 
 
 Someone screamed. 
 
 This, they would later find, was the sound these things used for attacks. 
 
 Someone, whoever they were, had accidentally started a war. 
 
 It charged and showed them a drooling maw of recurved teeth, its long, stiff tail whipping through foliage as it straightened out. On each of its feet was a massive, serrated claw. 
 
 It leapt and kicked Columbus in the stomach, spilling his intestines as it bit into his neck, breaking it instantly. 
 
 `` They are Demons.'' Said one of the Priests. `` Demons, straight from the pits of Hell itself! This land was made by Satan!'' 
 
 One of the boys shook his head, angry. Angry he had come all this way for a land full of....these. 
 
 `` No.'' He said. `` No. There's got to be land here. Got to be a way around them.'' 
 
 They heard the shrieking, outside, as the bird-demons began to swarm. 
 
 `` The laws of nature are very, very different here.'' He spun his knife. 
 
 `` And if we ever want to be free, we're going to have to adapt.''

","`` I do n't suppose you have a jetpack'' I tried to joke with whatever strength I had left, but the only thing that came out of my mouth were bubbles of blood. 
 
 The cab driver did n't respond. He was too focused on the sluggish traffic and talking with an emergency responder on the phone. Despite having the AC on full blast, beads of sweat rolled off of his forehead, slowly sliding down his brow, around his tired eyes, and finally blending with the tears caught in his wrinkles. 
 
 Sound is slowly but surely becoming muffled around me. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the leather seat. I tried to think how this could've been prevented. *Maybe if I took the time to make breakfast in the morning I would n't have been hit by this idiot in the drivers seat*. It did n't matter now. The impact had forced my ribs into my lungs. 
 
 Today was n't my best day by any stretch: I spilled coffee on my best shirt ( and now blood too ), a rebellious strand of hair stuck out the side of my head, I left my phone at home, and I forgot to turn on the washing machine. And now I'm here, my life in the hands of a man who's both trying to save me and killed me. It will be a meaningless death at best. 
 
 I wish I was hit after I had met up with my mom. The poor woman must be angry now that I'm an hour late. She would chew me out again with that same `` time is priceless!'' talk. Today was especially important; Dad has finally been able to land a stable job. He did n't have a formal education and came to this country with the clothes on his back. He worked tirelessly, sometimes as much as 14 hours a day so we'd have bread on the table. I rarely got to see him, and whenever he was home he'd have no time to talk. We were suppose to celebrate today now that we're finally on the path for a new beginning as a family. 
 
 When I was young, I used to resent him for not being with me. All my other friends had fathers who would pick them up from school, take them to McDonalds, or play sports with them. I on the other hand had to walk to school on my own, help my mom cook, and practice soccer with no one watching. `` Sorry,'' He would say, `` Daddy is very busy, please forgive me''. I used to think it was because he did n't want me as a son, but when I finally grew old enough to understand his sacrifice, I learned that it pained him immensely to turn me away. 
 
 This dinner was suppose to be special. It will be the first time that we have a proper talk as father and son at a dinner table. I wanted to tell him all about my life; my friends, school, health, my job. But most of all I wanted him to know how much I appreciated his devotion to this family, to us. 
 
 I opened my eyes and was met with the gaze of the cab driver. Tears are now streaming down his face. He was calling out to me. His phone now resting loosely on his leg. I felt my consciousness slipping, I knew had to make this quick. 
 
 I adjusted my shirt collar and leaned forward to clear my mouth of blood. With my final ounce of strength I placed my hand on the cab driver's shoulder. 
 
 
 `` Thanks for everything, dad''.

60279,"[ WP ] A kid tries to talk the monster under the bed into attacking the monster in the closet .
","Tim was having trouble sleeping. It was not because he was six years old and eight o ’ clock was too early a bedtime. It wasn ’ t because he had snuck the bag of Halloween candy out from his closet before bedtime and eaten enough to make him sick to his stomach. Nor was it because the missing night light. Tim had told his mom to unplug the night light four weeks ago, after all! Tim wasn ’ t kept awake for any of those things. Tim couldn ’ t sleep because his mom had forgotten to tuck him in with Chester, his stuffed rabbit. 
 
 Normally Chester sat calmly on the pillows of his bed during the day, a place of honor Tim would tell his friends was dictated by his mom. At night, Chester would be collected as the extra pillows were thrown to the floor carelessly, and placed next to Tim. Then, Tim would get a kiss on the forehead and a, “ Good night, sleep tight! ” as his bedroom door was shut. Tonight, however, Chester had been forgotten. Right now Chester was on the floor next to his bed, and Tim couldn ’ t collect him. 
 
 Tim couldn ’ t collect him because there was a monster under the bed. 
 
 Now it ’ s important to note that it wasn ’ t the monster itself that was keeping Tim awake. Tim was well aware of the monster ’ s existence. In fact, Tim knew that there were a total of three monsters in his room at night. One was the monster under the bed. Two was the monster behind the door. The door monster was something of a special case, because it was only present when the door was open and the light from the hallway spilled into his bedroom. The crack of light created a blind spot behind the bedroom door, where the door monster dwelled. For this reason he had slept with the door closed for a whole two weeks now. 
 
 The third monster was the monster in the closet. That was the most dangerous of the three monsters, because it was big. It had to be big, of course, otherwise it would live behind the door or under his bed, two very tight spaces. Luckily the monster in the closet was trapped in there, as Tim made sure to firmly shut the closet door each and every night. So despite the closet monster being the most dangerous, his night-to-night conflicts were always with the monster under the bed. 
 
 Inching his eyes over the ledge of the bed, Tim saw one of Chester ’ s folded ears. He inched a little bit more and Chester ’ s face appeared, glass bead eyes completely black in the bedroom ’ s darkness. Another inch and Tim ’ s nose was at the corner of his mattress. There he saw Chester ’ s torso, but the lower half of the rabbit disappeared into the abyss under the bed. More than that, Tim was horrified to see Chester was slowly rolling back and forth, like something unseen had sunken its claws into his rabbit ’ s legs and was slowly twisting. Left, right. Left, right. 
 
 That was too much for Tim to bear. With a cry of anguish his hands shot towards the rabbit. He grabbed Chester ’ s head, pulled, and was immediately met with a snarl of resistance. It was like the sound of a snake blowing bubbles. A hiss that should have been completely dry, but instead there was gurgling and popping. 
 
 “ Mine! ” hissed the voice from under the bed, “ Mine, mine, mine! ” 
 
 With a might squeal, the monster pulled Chester from Tim ’ s grasp and the rabbit disappeared fully under the bed. Then he heard a quiet gurgle, and then a coo. 
 
 Tim was beyond being scared now. He was angry. But despite his anger, he know the monster was stronger than him. Instead of diving down under the bed to fight the monster, Tim instead said, “ Chester is my rabbit, and you need to give him back to me! ” 
 
 At first there was no response, but the rustling from under the bed lessened somewhat. Then he heard the hissing, gurgling voice, “ Mine. All mine. ” 
 
 Tim narrowed his eyes at the edge of the shadow that separated under the bed from the rest of his room. “ That ’ s not true, ” Tim said. “ Not everything is yours. ” He paused for a minute, then took one of his socks off. Dangling the toe of the sock below his mattress, he said, “ This sock isn ’ t yours. ” 
 Without any hesitation, the sock was pulled from his grip with such force that, even suspecting what would happen, Tim was taken off guard. “ My sock, mine! ” said the voice from under the bed. 
 
 Now Tim was truly stumped. He had hoped to bargain the sock for Chester with the monster, but now he could see that wouldn ’ t work. The monster was just too strong. No, Tim himself needed something strong to deal with the monster under the bed. Looking around again, Tim ’ s eyes landed on the closet. 
 
 “ I know something that isn ’ t yours. ” Tim said. 
 
 There was no response. 
 
 “ There ’ s a bag full of candy in my closet. Completely full. That ’ s my candy. ” 
 
 At first there was no response, but then the monster spoke again. The voice was less venomous this time, different than how the monster had spoken before, “ His candy. His. His! His! ” 
 
 “ No no, ” Tim said, “ Your candy. ” 
 
 “ My? ” the monster under the bed said. 
 
 “ Yes, ” Tim said, nodding his head enthusiastically, even though the monster couldn ’ t see him. “ Your bag full of candy. You just need to go get it. ” 
 
 The monster under the bed didn ’ t say anything else, and almost a minute passed without a sound coming from under the bed. Tim thought his plan had failed, and he would have to go the rest of the night without Chester, resorting to collecting his beloved rabbit after the sun rose in the morning. 
 Just as Tim lost hope, he heard a rustling from the foot of his bed. He pulled his blankets up to his eyes and stared over the lump his feet caused in the sheets, to his closet door on the opposite side of the room. The door was firmly shut, but still imposing in the darkness. The moon was very bright tonight, and his window cast a moon shadow cast across the closet door, illuminating it unnaturally. 
 
 Tim heard a whisper in the room, “ Mine, ” and the closet door creeped open. 
 
 A heavy breathing came from the closet, like a dragon ’ s breath rattling out from the depths of its lair. Tim heard a gurgling hiss, and then a furious roar and loud thud, like something had been thrown against a wall. 
 
 Tim pulled the cover over his eyes as the noises continued. Hissing, breathing, gurgling, rattling, all accompanied by an occasional thud against the wall or rattling of clothes hanger on its peg. It was horrible, terrible, and Tim couldn ’ t stand the noises any longer. He just wanted it to stop! 
 
 Finally the noises slowed to a stop and Tim dared to peek. There was no more growling or thumping against the walls and everything seemed calm. The only evidence there had ever been a fight was the fur still floating out from the crack in the closet door, set afire by the moonlight like glimmering lines of spider web. 
 
 Then the door moved again, creaking open just a little bit more. Tim didn ’ t see anything come out, but he did hear something being dragged across the floor, and a pained gurgle, as if the monster under the bed was injured. 
 
 A bag was thrown onto his bed, arching up from the floor. It landed right next to his feet, and Tim saw candy spilling out from a tear on the side. He sat up quickly, his feet working to push him away from the bag and into a sitting position. Right next to the bag of candy from over the ledge of the bed, a sock appeared. It was Tim ’ s sock, but now it had sharp, evil looking claws poking out from the toe seam. 
 
 “ My sock, my candy, ” said a gurgling, hissing voice. 
 
 Then Chester appeared next to the clawed sock. The rabbit ’ s stuffed arms were propped on the mattress as if he was holding on, and his glass bead eyes caught a glimmer of moonlight and looked directly at Tim. 
 
 “ My rabbit, my closet, my bed, ” said the monster. 
 
 The two felt teeth sewn onto Chester ’ s face moved slightly as more claws slowly protruded out from behind them. The monster was working its little hand through the stuffing of Tim ’ s rabbit, and out the front of Chester ’ s head. Chester fell onto the bed face forward as the monster ’ s claws found purchase in the sheets. A shadow loomed up onto the bed, and Tim couldn ’ t hold his scream in any longer.

 `` Yeah, can I have a large pepperoni-'' I started. Someone in the background asked me to pick up a meat lovers instead. There was a short argument, `` On second thought can you make it half pepperoni and half sausage.'' 
 
 `` Are you confident?'' She sounded nervous. I could n't understand why. 
 
 `` Yeah I want that pizza.'' 
 
 `` Sir, would you like soda too?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, I think we definitely need Coke,'' I said eyeing the bottle of chase that had been stolen by basically everyone. We'd brought two bottles, but we were already running out. 
 
 `` Hol-'' she began, `` yes as fast as possible sir.'' 
 
 `` Yeah I'll pay cash at the door okay.'' 
 
 `` Hold tight sir we are on our way.'' She sounded desperate, panicked even. I did n't know what was going on but if they were going to be stressed about a pizza, it might as well have been mine. I turned back to the rest of the party. Beer pong looked like it was somewhat open. I walked over there to see if I could slip in for a game. 
 
 About ten minutes later there was the sound of sirens outside. I shushed everyone, `` do n't worry it's not late enough that they are going to kick us out, just a friendly reminder I think,'' I pointed out to my girlfriend Jess as she came up to me. She seemed satisfied with my explanation and sat down on the couch with one of her friends. I went to grab the door. 
 
 I did n't need to; the door was kicked in, and I was shoved back against the wall. I smashed into it and shook my head, `` Woah-woah-woah,'' I started, `` What the hell is going on?'' 
 
 `` That's a match for the voice,'' came a female voice from the other side of the door. The same man who had kicked the door in grabbed it and pulled it off of me, `` what's your name?'' the woman asked. 
 
 `` Jeff,'' I stuttered, `` what's going on?'' 
 
 `` Jeff, what's the code?'' she asked. She walked into sight; she was a complete bombshell, but her tits were ruined by the fact that she was carrying an assault rifle, `` I'm not fucking around, what's the code?'' 
 
 `` I do n't know.'' 
 
 `` What do you mean you do n't know,'' she took the gun and pressed it hard against my forehead, `` You called for this bullshit if you're who you claim you are you'd better give me the code in ten seconds.'' 
 
 `` What the fuck.'' 
 
 `` Ten.'' 
 
 `` No seriously.'' 
 
 `` Nine.'' 
 
 One of my friends cut in, `` You ca n't just do that, he has rights.'' 
 
 `` Eight.'' 
 
 `` I was trying to order a pizza!'' I shouted. She suddenly pulled the gun off of my forehead. 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` I wanted pizza.'' 
 
 `` Y-you thought you were calling for pizza?'' She repeated what I said. 
 
 `` Yes, I thought I was calling for Pizza I'm sorry.'' 
 
 `` How did you get the number so wrong.'' 
 
 `` I'm drunk,'' I admitted, `` I'm only 20 but I'm drunk, and I'm sorry.''

","between them. It was close, unbelievably close. The skin on the palm of his hand blistered but he still he moved forward. Opposite him, this mountain of heat and stench lay unmoving, but curious now. He could n't remember the last time a human had the audacity to approach him. Why he'd not hesitated as the heat curled the skin of his hand was beyond the dragon. The gap closed between the human's hand and his nostril. The dragon's warning growl rolled past his teeth and rattled the pebbles at the human's feet. 
 
 `` Well this is curious indeed.'' Said Marcus. `` I can only imagine that I've finally found what I am looking for.'' He chuckled as if enjoying a joke that only he understood. The dragon peered down at the tiny human and noticed the man's milky-white pupils. Still Marcus' hand rested on the dragon's nostril. He dug his fingers in and tried picking at one of the dragon's amber scales. The man's skin cracked and bled and yet he seemed unhurt by the heat. 
 
 `` I have a request of you dragon.'' Marcus said. 
 
 `` You may not make requests of me.'' 
 
 `` I am dying.'' Marcus said, choosing to ignore the dragon's response. `` I have very little time left. The gods have taken my family, taken my senses, and are now taking what is left. I can feel it in my bones, sapping what strength I have left. There is no one left that I care about. Before I go, I would leave an impression on those who rejected me. I would get my revenge on those who tossed me aside like so much trash.'' 
 
 The dragon, his curiosity now piqued, coiled his serpentine neck and spit a small plume of smoke into the air. The man retracted his arm. Blood and pus dripped down his arm to pool around the man's feet. He did n't seem bothered by the pain at all. 
 
 `` What would you have me do?'' He asked. If the human wanted to be eaten, he would gladly comply. 
 
 `` I want to ride you into battle.'' The dragon hissed his displeasure. 
 
 `` Why would you choose to fight for those who threw you away?'' The dragon asked. The man's face twisted into a broken smile. 
 
 `` Oh I'm not fighting for them.'' He seethed. `` Not for them. I want to fight against them. I want them to know the despair I felt. Every door that was shut in my face needs to be reduced to ashes. I want to hear the screams of dying men. I want to bask in the panic and fear. I want to die knowing that I will never be forgotten. I want them to look up and see me lit in fire and death and know that I will be the last thing they see before death takes them. Every man who ignored my cry for help needs to understand this pain.'' His fingers crackled as he made fists and the dragon looked on with pride as the man began peeling his skin off. 
 
 `` If I am to do this for you. Several things must be done.'' The dragon said. Marcus stuttered for a moment before recollecting himself. He had n't expected the dragon to comply so easily. `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 `` I will go with you to this end.'' Said the dragon. `` But this will not be your end. You will live long enough for my hunger to be satiated. And then, when I am content, you may die.''

173002,"[ WP ] You 're an extremely old vampire , during your life time humanity has died , all of a sudden the sun is getting closer .
","In the beginning, there was light. 
 
 Horrible, blinding, burning light. 
 
 And there was hunger. 
 
 My existence was a balancing act. The hunger drove me on, to feed, to slake. The light drove me back, to hide, to cower. Some times the sky was too blinding to contemplate. I stayed in my deep cave with nothing to occupy my mind but the hunger. When the sky faded I would venture out, carefully, cautiously. Sometimes it was still too bright, the stars enough to burn my eyes, the moon enough to burn my skin. But on those rare nights when the night was overcast, when the moon was gone, on those nights I was a king before the world knew the word king. Oh, how I feasted. Every creature of the land was mine to take. 
 
 But the most delicious were always the ones who looked almost like me. Stubbier, more crude, but in form and template, like myself. Over years, I grew accustomed to even the moon's harsh glare, and I could pick off these beautiful cattle almost at my leisure. And how they feared me. 
 
 They feared me so, they learned to keep fires burning in the night. Disaster! The piercing glow of the fires drove me back again, back into the darkness. I was reduced to subsisting off lesser flesh, occasionally prowling the edges of man's camps. From time to time some blessed fool amongst them would forget why they kept the nightfires burning, and venture too far into the shadows, drunk on bravado or fermented fruit. They were drunk, and I drank. 
 
 It took a long time for me to acclimatise even to the firelight glow. Thousands of years. How long had it taken me to no longer fear the moon? I did not know. As I aged, my mind grew sharper, my abilities more fearsome. I learned to call to my prey, lure them out. A few susceptible creatures I even broke to my will, using them to lead others out to their slaughter. Only a few, and only here and there. They bred so slowly I had to roam, an itinerant monster. A peripatetic predator. 
 
 It was simple, as the tribes of man wandered too. I would follow one, and when they encountered another I would switch from one to the other, like a curse in the night. But gradually they stopped wandering, set down settlements. Villages, then towns, then cities. 
 
 I remember now walking the streets of Ur, all but black bar the homes of the mighty. But why prey on the mighty when the weak were so much more numerous, so much more shadowed? 
 
 The more I drank, the more I developed, and man was now so numerous. 
 
 Cities went from shadowed mazes of clay and wood to glittering edifices of glass and light, but by then I was *strong*. Emboldened by my own might and so many millenia of exposure to increasingly bright world, I no longer feared even the twilight. Through the great cities of the West I moved, and as the West declined I stalked the towering supercities of the East. By the time of the great continent-spanning Sudanese Empire I no longer feared even the mid day sun. I would stare at it triumphant, an old enemy defeated. It seemed so weak now, though I knew it had not changed. 
 
 I had changed. The old balance between hunger and fear that had defined my existence in days gone by seemed so inconsequential now. There was so little to fear, and so *much* on which to feed. 
 
 And alas, as I changed, so had my prey. 
 
 In the nights of fire and dark, I had been their greatest predator. A monster of myth, the very devil himself. Now I had been far outshone in man's nightmares by man himself. 
 
 I could not begrudge them this change. I had only ever picked them off one at a time, a few sloppy indulgences notwithstanding. Man threatened himself with wholesale destruction. Through nuclear fire, through designer viruses, and through that simple but potent mix of sloppy stupidity and cunning cupidity. Perhaps the odds were only ever low, but how they loved to roll the dice. 
 
 It was inevitable that their luck would turn. And so it did. 
 
 There are no men now. None of my beautiful cattle. And no other animals besides. Their cities are bare rock and old metal. The lush forests in which I hunted are deserts. The seas are acid, and shelter nothing beyond the tiniest single-celled extremophiles. 
 
 I fear nothing now. But the *HUNGER*. I have not fed in so long. There has been nothing on which to feed. Nothing! I can feel my mind slipping. Some times I stand and watch the sky flicker day to night to day to night to day to night... once I stood a century, until the dust grew to cover my eyes. But though my mind fades, my body remains strong as diamond, and try as I might I can not find a way to die. 
 
 The crushing pressures of the abyssal plain do naught. Falling from the highest peak, nothing. I set out to find some volcanic vent, but I have left it too LATE. In all the waiting, all the nights of insane hunger, the earth has cooled. There are none to be found! The knowledge that I might have ended this all if I'd acted sooner would torment me, if there were room in my mind for aught but hunger. 
 
 Nothing on this dry and lifeless ball of rock can kill me now. It is me, and my hunger, with no end in sight. I claw the flesh from my own bones, a pitiful creature, impotent and deranged. 
 
 And then, salvation. The sun. In a rare moment of lucidity, I see the sun. It has grown... some twice its normal size in the sky. Of course. There is no such thing as eternal life, not really. Even stars die. 
 
 I weep, for I am saved. I do not know how long it will take, but the sun will take this world, and take me with it, to blessed oblivion. 
 
 My oldest foe becomes my saviour.

","Two hundred and twelve. That's how many humans are left on Earth. 
 
 Thirty-seven years we've fought against the Unkabi, and for 37 years they've slowly but steadily whittled away our numbers. 
 
 `` Today, we make our final stand! Not for our country, not for our respective Gods, but for the existence of our race!'' 
 I stopped paying attention, this pep talk was only slightly more motivating than the last hundred or so I'd heard, but in essence it was the same. Do n't give up, the human race depends on it. But I knew, and everyone around me knew, we were doomed. Our last camp was surrounded, all exits blocked. 212 humans against countless thousands of Unkabi. We would fight, like we always did, and we would lose, like we always did. And this time, it would be for good. We all knew it. 
 
 Once the speech was over, the morose but determined remainder of the human race manned their respective posts. 
 
 From my foxhole on the perimeter, I looked down on the glittering expanse of the strange green lights the Unkabi used, like the field itself was glowing. In the distance I heard their bone shattering battle horn expel it's final charge. I braced myself for battle, and death. 
 
 As the mass of invaders made their final charge, I aimed down the sights of my rifle. As the front lines came into range, I began to open fire. As I sighted in on my second target, however, he fell out of sight. I started to switch targets, not sparing a moment's thought, and realized I could n't find one. Sounds of confusion began to pierce the eerie silence. 
 
 I looked up, and saw... a miracle. 
 
 The ground opened up in giant gaping holes, swallowing hundreds of Unkabi at once. Tree roots flew out of the ground, skewering enemy troops. Some of them burst with what looked like mold, or fungus spores. Birds of prey swooped from the sky in massive hordes, enough to blot out the sun had it been up, pecking and scratching anything they could. Everywhere I looked, nature was on the offensive. I'd never seen anything like it. 
 
 212 humans stood, on the front line, mouths agape, unable to comprehend what we were seeing. Finally, someone in command regained their wits and sounded the charge. And for the first time in 37 years, we attacked with hope, not desperation.

I watch the sun set for the final time, it stays hidden for 6 months, then the world, once again, awakens. At this latitude all I ’ ve known is the midnight sun, and the noon day blackness, but this sunset is different. A strange feeling resides in the air, though I know not why. A desert of snow, only brings loneliness, so I must be feeling empty emotions. 
 
 “ Jonas, you up there? ” 
 
 “ Yeah, why do you care? ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t know, just some people can get carried away by the sunset ” 
 
 “ I ’ m fine… I ’ m fine ” 
 
 “ All right, I ’ ll see you at 10 ” 
 
 “ whatever ” 
 
 I never really care. My mind is as empty as the vast horizon of this infinite land of ice. Minutes pass yet nothing happens. 
 
 … 
 
 “ JEFF, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS! ” 
 
 The radio is static. 
 
 “ JEFF?! ” 
 
 “ … ” 
 
 The man, swiftly, approaches the gate, steadying my rifle, I aim to shoot, yet curiosity has overwhelmed my mind. Motionless, I watch the man stare for what seems like hours, until all of the sudden he runs to the horizon. Why I refrained from killing, I know not why. Unbeknownst to my mind, this would be the biggest mistake of my life. The sun has almost left, but silhouetting to her rays on the horizon, approaches lines and lines of horses, chariots, and knighted men riding at an innumerable pace towards the wall of the golden city. 
 
 “ JEFF PLEASE ANSWER THE FREAKIN' RADIO! ” 
 
 “ … ” 
 
 The entire land is filled with the army, yet they remain mysterious as the city itself. Is this the end? Thinking of what to do, my heart became pierced with an arrow and I fell into the snow. Blood flowing, pain overflowing every nerve of my body, I watch time fade away into obscurity. However, the last thing I saw was the cold glare of a person lost with the rest humanity into the oblivious fog of uncertainty. 
 
 I have come to lie in the ground with the rest of the mistake that is the human race. This army pushed so long to arrive at the golden city, yet, like everybody else, they did not know they could make it this far, so the wanderers raided until they themselves fell into the snow to live in the dirt with what was once the proud human race. 
 
 Because that is what everything is, dirt in different forms.

","Sure, VR-MMOs have been hot for a while. But this new one... well, the raid boss isnt a fight you can win. I figured out why- combat isnt the intended solution. He is only a gatekeeper, however powerful he looks. 
 
 With my magic, I showed him the sigil. It was easy enough to deduce, from the riddles and puzzles hidden through the area preceding his room. He gazed upon it, then nodded. He lowered his staff, and its petals opened- reveling a chair within. 
 
 I sat upon the chair and he lifted me up. the petals began to spin, and the sphere took off, carrying me above the cloud and fog that covered the frozen lake, above the floating stone spikes. I got screenshots, the entire layout of the maze i had passed through earlier revealed beneath me. 
 
 The sphere ascended, and I gazed upon the shrinking world below as i rose to the third moon.....

 Giving rise to occasional 
 Hair-raising frights

 Last Sunday at 5 
 Was more hairless than scary 
 And barely alive 
 
 `` Thank god you're open!'' 
 He says with a sigh 
 As he loosens his belt 
 And unzips his fly 
 
 I watch in shocked silence 
 As he climbs on the table 
 Head as bald as an eagle 
 Gut hair full, rich and sable 
 
 Sweat pours off his back 
 And pools on the floor

 My colon's at war!''

 He turns as I reach in 
 And pull out a kite 
 
 `` Do n't you worry! Almost done! 
 And this eighth item's a real win!'' 
 I slide the package into his mouth

","It's a place I avoid, heaven; full of arrogant, self-righteous lawyers. They stand around, examining the text of the law I gave them, and having arguments. 
 
 Arguments! In heaven! 
 
 They all come in announcing that they have kept the law, and yet they still argue over what it means. And they expect me to believe them? What a joke. 
 
 Why do I only seem to attract idiots? I mean, they are intelligent enough as people go, but they put the mental stumbling block right in front of their faces! They embrace absurd, non-human explanations for their lives, and then argue over how it all makes sense. 
 
 Forever, apparently. 
 
 And is this what my eternity is going to look like? There are an astounding number of potential candidates for heaven! I had wanted SO MANY people to get in, but I barely get any applications. It's these Levites and Lawyers, Scribes and Righteous men, who have given me a bad name. I tasked them with teaching the world how to live well, but did they? Serving only themselves, they convinced everyone that the law was about not eating food, rather than morality. They tithed mint, and dill, and cumin, but still do n't understand love or mercy! 
 
 And here they stand, in heaven, as a living mockery of justice. 
 
 But what is to be done? I already gave them law! I told them, quite clearly, what to do! But the world does n't even give my instructions a second look, thanks to these self-absorbed swine. 
 
 I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get rid of this entire system that produces only arrogant fools and lost little sheep. I'll get rid of it. I'll replace it with a system that will be genuinely just. No more exploiting loopholes of a law! No more waiting around for lazy, clueless men to bring righteousness to the nations! No more of this. 
 
 I will do it myself. My own right hand will get the work done, filling my house with genuinely righteous people. No longer will I rely on them to teach each other about me, as I will teach them all directly; from the least to the greatest! I will go down myself and teach them myself. I will fill them with my own Spirit; whoever wants it! I myself will direct them how to live. 
 
 THAT will accomplish a heaven worthy of its name! And if the sleazy lawyers do n't get the message, well, I wo n't really miss them.

88471,"[ WP ] Two brothers wage war over an empty throne . Write the final battle .
","16 years. The time it took a boy to mature from a child to a man. 16 long years. Nearly as much time had passed in the kingdom since there had been a true king sitting on the throne. Two brothers claiming the same seat, both masterful tacticians and rulers, had plunged the kingdom into a confusing struggle for supremacy. 
 Every method was permitted and no pardon was given. Whether their vast armies fought on wide plains clashing sword and shield or cloaked men came with dagger and poison into their homes disrupting peaceful tranquility, the two brothers did bulge not one inch in their desire to succeed their father. 
 As the land was slowly bereft of every boon it once held, whether or not it be men, women, wood or iron, the siblings saw their loved ones die: their wives, slain through hidden blade and noxious apple, their sons, lying dead on distant battlefields, their daughters, thrown for hollow coins into loveless hands. No sympathy should have been left. 
 
 Yet through fate or accident they met again at their fathers grave, who had perished 16 long years ago. Both were genuinely surprised seeing the other, though they did not feel hateful thoughts clouding their mind. As they stood there beneath the statue of their father, a withering slab of stone that had lost all its distinctiveness to time, their eyes were locked firmly on one another. 
 On the one side stood Wilhelm, the older and shorter brother. His stature was that of a warrior, firm and strong like an old tree, the elapsed years carved clearly into his weathered skin. His right hand was gleaming in the sun, as it had been replaced by a crude steel apparatus, bone and flesh lost on the field of battle a mere 3 years ago. 
 Johann, the younger one, instead stood tall and haughty. Though both were of similar age, time had largely spared him of its touch, as both his face and posture remained youthful and fresh. Yet there was a slight tremor rocking through his body, a remnant of disease and poison that had struck body and mind in the past. 
 
 No word was spoken as blades were drawn: a beautiful scimitar, acquired from foreign hands matching the appearance of its owner, and a steel longsword, forged a thousand times as a simple tool for simple hands. 
 Their weapons crossed under the watchful eye of their stony father, both evenly matched in skill. The raspy sound of steel against steel began to compose an eerie cacophony filling the surroundings accompanied by their deadly dance. As they struck out against each other, their minds were lifted slowly of burdensome thoughts. The memory of their wives faded out first, only remaining as a warm feeling in their hearts. Images of their sons began to blurry and wither as their fight grew faster and faster, a familiar regret siphoned out of both siblings. Finally the thought of their daughters, though still alive yet far away, bid farewell to both brothers, leaving them only to themselves. 
 
 A shattering ring filled the battlefield as the swords met for the last time. Scars now embellished the once beautiful scimitar, while an ugly crack ran through the length of the longsword. Both were dropped by exhausted hands, their blades burying deep into the soft soil. Not long after two heavy bodies fell down beside their steel guard, battered and broken. 
 The war ended that day, 16 years after it had begun. Two brothers slain by each other's hand had fought those 16 long years, yet none was to sit the throne.

","`` That's it?'' 
 
 Ranger Muir hated school groups. Children who did n't live through the invasion did n't understand the importance of what they were seeing. A forty-five minute field trip to the memorial certainly was n't going to change that. Humanity had never been closer to total extinction - and probably never would again until their time was finally up. Teams of scientists had worked around the clock in this very facility to develop bio-enhanced incendiary ordnance. Without the prospect of annihilation, decimated militaries around the world never would have agreed to coordinate desperate nighttime strikes. Ten years later, the fragile peace still held - barely - as humanity rebuilt. 
 
 `` It looks like a bunch of stupid trees that fell down.'' 
 
 Muir could tell from the start that this kid was the worst kind of brat on his tours, full of asinine comments that he assumed everyone around him was just waiting to hear. Biting his tongue, Muir gave his standard response: `` The invaders had many similarities to terrestrial plant life. They evolved on their own world to convert solar rays to energy in the pods on their skin, much like photosynthesis in plant leaves, but much more powerful. Have you learned about photosynthesis in your science class yet?'' No reaction. He went on... `` Obviously, they can move - more like snakes than trees. Much more intelligent than snakes, though. Snakes do n't have spaceships or lasers.'' Still nothing from the class. ``... So, what you're seeing are some of the last remains we have. Many heroes lost their lives to capture these samples, but without their bravery, we never would have developed the weapons we needed to defeat the invaders. We keep the remains here in this underground lab, even though we've stopped running tests years ago. Just dead matter. Now, if you follow me back to the elevators...'' 
 
 There was a flash; Ranger Muir spun back around. The kid stood there, setting up a second photo. Muir felt his temper boil over, but before he could let loose, a gasp arose from the group. Behind the glass, a green tendril started to wave in the breeze - but the air in the bunker was perfectly still. They watched in horror as the tentacle rose, curled... and slowly flopped back onto the ground. Everything was still. The group released their breath. 
 
 The next day, the viewing room was blanketed in brand-new signs: `` Visitors are reminded that flash photography is not permitted, as it may disturb the corpses''

 `` Umm hello, I need help with my Windows, it says it's not activated so it's not working'' Replied a voice that thundered as the words hit Rakesh's ears.

 `` I upgraded from me-damn windows 7 and nothing works, I did n't buy a windows key because it's supposed to give me one when I upgraded!'' Gods voice thundered and the microphone crackled a little. 
 
 `` Sir, I have told you before to calm down, please do not raise your voice at me I am trying to help you, please go to the windows store and buy a new windows 10 from there, it appears your key is not genuine, contact your system administrator and tell them you are having the trouble, there is nothing we can do for you today.''

66762,"[ WP ] You are a medieval knight that just ate a magic mushroom without knowing what would happen .
","The King had decided that, as a dishonorable Knight, it was fit to see me punished in order to regain my Honor. Therefore, I was blindfolded and tied up, taken to a far away land, and left to my own devices. I was instructed that my Honor would return should I make it back to the King's palace with God's will and assistance. 
 
 The ropes were loose, and the blindfold fell off without as much as a twitch of my neck. I stood up and looked around. I was in a maze of a forest, with twisting turns and a silhouette of light leaking down from the tops of the trees. Determined to regain my honor, I began finding my way back to the Kingdom. 
 
 I traveled for several days, managing to find water along the path but very little food. I was sure that, without a blessing from God, I was doomed to perish due to severe hunger. I trudged along until I noticed a sparkling green mushroom along the path. As I approached it, it smelled heavenly; it was a smell not unlike that of a hearty lamb and potato dinner. I greedily and hungrily devoured the mushroom, tasting the delicious flavors of lamb and potato and feeling the energy flowing back into my body. 
 
 The mushroom was delicious; it quenched my thirst and my aching hunger from traveling for several days without food. As I walked through the path, I noticed that the world was starting to change. It was subtle at first; the sky was a little brighter, the trees a little taller. 
 
 Then suddenly, the ground fell from underneath me and I plunged down into the abyss for hours. I could n't see anything; the darkness overwhelmed my senses and dulled me to my plight. My armor became so hot that I thought my skin was going to start burning and melt. Eventually, I hit a solid surface and broke my left leg. 
 
 I struggled to right myself and I looked around. It was horrific. There was blood everywhere, loud screams of never-ending terror and reality was constantly bending in unpredictable ways. Animals would disappear, and then reappear smaller or merged with other objects, like horses or rocks. I watched one particular animal reappear fifteen times, each time coming back more gruesome and disfigured before. 
 
 My broken leg instantly repaired itself, and I was able to stand up. I could not walk or run, as every step locked me in place. It was as if I was on a endless path, unable to advance or retreat, stuck in perpetual motion and powerless to affect the gruesome scene around me. 
 
 As I watched for hours, stuck on the Endless Path, the scenery started to become even more bleak. Volcanoes were appearing now, spewing lava several lengths high into the sky. Animals were disappearing and reappearing at quicker intervals, often appearing as masses of tissue, blood, leaves and rocks. The trees and the grass started to grow sharp spikes, which continued to grow infinitely faster. 
 
 The destruction which was once far in the distance was steadily approaching my position. I tried to run, but I was stuck in place on the Endless Path. It seemed that the mushroom which temporarily saved my life was about to end it. 
 
 Tornadoes appeared, viciously whipping up the bloody masses into the air, blending them and raining massive droplets of blood on the ground. The blood droplets formed hurricanes which ravaged the countryside and made the spiked foliage poisonous to the touch. 
 
 The devastation overwhelmed my senses, and I was overcome with grief. I awaited my fate, screaming out to God for torturing me in this way. 
 
 The grass under my feet was growing taller now, with massive spikes starting to protrude. At first, I heard a light tap on my armor; I could feel the mounting pressure exerted from the spikes. Then, the spikes started to tear through my armor and my body, lifting me high in the air and dripping my blood on the grass. This had the effect of enraging the grass, and I was violently whipped about while being impaled on the spikes. 
 
 As I took my last breath, the blood hurricane enveloped me. 
 
 The knight was ripped apart and torn to pieces by the hurricane. Eventually, the planet imploded under the weight of the foliage. Its moons collided with the rest of the planets in the Solar System, dislodging them from orbit and sending them out into space for the rest of eternity.

 _________ 
 
 I met a traveller from an antique land... I always loved that poem. 
 
 The figure landed in the dry grass from a light that was n't there any more. Steam rose from his suit, as he tried to get up. I stood there, a few meters away wearing my morning robe and even then I was sweating. The summer had been unbearable... my garden looked like a nuclear wasteland. 
 
 Ice flakes broke loose from his suit and fell to ground where it melted. I could have helped him up, it would have made it a lot easier, but the idea of cold burns was not really one I liked to entertain. The popsicle in my mouth was more than enough against the heat. 
 
 He sad on his knees before battling his helmet off. It fell to the ground and let loose his long, flowing hair. `` You are not Anir!'' the heat had melted away my surprise. 
 
 The young woman met my gaze and blinked once before saying something. `` Off cause I'm not Anir!'' 
 
 `` Well...'' off cause she was his... he could never get to the point himself. `` How did he die?'' 
 
 She got up and walked past me, towards the house. `` Cancer!'' she said, when she was next to me. 
 
 `` You still have that in your timeline? Or the future? or whatever it is...'' She walked into the living room and looked around. `` Clothes is on the chair, though it was meant for Anir!'' I looked at her, as she looked around. She looked like a cat, a tiny kitten, caught in box, looking for a way out. `` I made some lemonade! It's on the counter!'' 
 
 She walked straight towards the glass and emptied it, in one long drag. `` Crap! It's sweet!'' 
 
 I walked into the cold air and placed my butt in the other chair, next to the pile of clothes. `` You need help getting it off?'' 
 
 She downed another glass, and then another. Great that I made so many. She finally looked at me. `` No... no, I do n't need your help!'' her cheeks was red, but that could have been the heat. 
 
 Of cause she ended up needing my help, in the end. I sat back in the chair, after she had gotten dressed. `` So... why are you here? What has gone to shit now?'' 
 
 She sat in the spare chair, and looked at me. `` My grandfather send me...'' she gasped for air. `` Something in his will!'' 
 
 `` This your first time travelling?'' 
 
 she nodded. `` When am I?'' 
 
 `` 1984... last time I checked?'' 
 
 `` Who is president?'' 
 
 I shrugged. `` The same as always... I do n't really care for politics...'' 
 
 `` Heh...'' a tiny sound, from a tiny girl. `` His will said that about you!'' 
 
 Off cause it did! `` What else did it say?'' 
 
 `` That you only care about your garden...'' she looked out trough the glass doors. `` It looks like shit!'' 
 
 `` Well...'' Anir was always the one with the snarky remarks. `` Big Brother has not really allowed much water, other than what we drink, though he might take away, at some point!'' 
 
 `` Maybe...'' 
 
 `` Is he why you are here?'' 
 
 `` Not really... though it might be his turn someday...'' she blew out the last of her foreign air. `` Did you have roses?'' she pointed towards the now dead bush. 
 
 `` I did... though they do n't respond well to the heat!'' 
 
 `` You should get Amaranths... I read they are hard to kill!'' 
 
 `` Only a cactus could survive this weather...'' I look at her, though she never meat my eyes. `` Do they still have plants in your timeline?'' 
 
 `` That's classified!'' like a machine she said it. I already missed Anir's boyish smile. `` When did you last see him?'' 
 
 `` Bout a week ago!'' I could still smell his dreadful aftershave. It hang in the clothes, even after a wash. `` We had to save some fat bloke from getting mustard on his sandwich... thought it might carry some form of malaria! He disappeared shortly after that.'' 
 
 `` His timeline was terminated...'' she filled her lungs. `` Perfectly natural!'' 
 
 `` But he still remembered me, whenever he came back!'' 
 
 `` That is definitely classified information!'' she dragged a smile. It was shortly lived. `` You could plant orchids? I hear that they are better to plant inside, or maybe some bonsai threes! Always liked how they looked!'' 
 
 `` Why are you staling?'' she did n't even look at me then. `` Anir would always tell me what to do... he would be slow about it, but he would get to it, at some point!'' 
 
 She sighed. 
 
 I sighed. `` Is it already time?'' I knew already before the end, when I saw the gun in her lab. White matt steel that did n't shine in the sunlight. `` When is he coming?'' 
 
 `` 35 year old Anir is supposed to arrive in four hours. He is a first time traveller, from another timeline, and is supposed to meet a young Amy, that will help him complete his mission!'' 
 
 `` Just like back then...'' 
 
 `` Just like back then...'' she repeated. `` Where did you hide your suit?'' 
 
 `` Buried it in the garden, under the rosebush! The others are there to!'' 
 
 `` Thanks, Amy!'' 
 
 `` Your welcome, Amy!'' 
 
 She rose from the chair, and pointed the gun towards me. `` Any last wishes?'' 
 
 I chewed on it for a second. `` Is my timeline still alive?'' 
 
 `` Off cause it is...'' she said mockingly. `` And you saved it!'' 
 
 I was once a traveller from an antique land, but now I have come home again.

","`` Oh lucky me, how clever me!'' sang the thief in a hushed tone. He moved quickly from one shadow to the next. He snuck up behind one unsuspecting victim, took what he wanted, then tip-toed off to whoever would happen to be his next target. 
 
 Those who were robbed would n't know of this theft for days or weeks, if at all. For the thief did n't make off with money, never snagged a purse, has n't touched a jewel, what he desired has far more value than them. The thief's prize was peoples' luck. 
 
 Oh, what luck he would find! Each person a pool of luck, each with no knowledge of how vulnerable these pools were. All of them pickings for the thief to be plucked at his pleasure as he marveled at what fortunes each `` luck pool'' brought to their previous holders. 
 
 *This one survived a particularly dangerous car crash. * 
 
 *That one has hid their affair all too well. * 
 
 *He got the promotion of a lifetime. * 
 
 *She found the man of her dreams. * 
 
 Moving into the thick of the crowd, the thief immersed himself in stealing all the luck that came near him. Only the thief knew of how to take others' luck. Only the thief was aware of what he was doing. 
 
 *Just think! * Thought the thief, *In a month, maybe two, of this then I'll be lucky enough to get away with anything! * 
 
 He was thinking of what he'll do with all his luck. Should he win the lottery? Should he run for president? Be a daredevil to gain fame as well? 
 
 Just then someone passed by the thief. The thief felt that he barely sapped a fraction of his luck. If he took the rest of that man's luck, the thief could spend the next month swimming in lottery winnings instead of slowly sapping luck. The thief stalked this luck filled man, as he twisted and turned in the maze of the crowd. The luck filled man dove into an alleyway with the thief closing in. 
 
 *A dark alleyway? Does he know I'm following him? No matter, I'm so lucky that I could leave unharmed from whatever he's planning. * 
 
 Turning into the alley, the Thief was at a loss to find that the luck filled man to be nowhere in sight. He went deeper into the alley, eyes darting to each nook and cranny, seeking the man. There must be some place he overlooked! He must be around somewhere! 
 
 **CRACK** 
 
 That was all the thief felt and heard before he fell to the ground with the back of his skull feeling wetter and warmer. He could feel his luck draining away. 
 
 `` You know there's few people with our ability, you and I,'' said the luck filled man. Before the thief's vision filled with black he heard the man say something he did n't understand until later.

 A bright white light filled the thief's vision. As the blinding light faded he saw he was in a hospital room with a doctor looming over him. `` You're awake'' said the doctor. 
 
 `` What happened?'' asked the thief, unsure if he wanted to know the answer. 
 
 `` You were found near death in an alleyway. I'm sorry but your injury has left you paralyzed from the neck down. But given the severity of your injury, I'd say you're lucky to be alive.''

195384,"[ WP ] You are immortal , and you 've managed to keep it a secret for all your life . But this week makes it almost impossible for various reasons ...
","I've lived a long life, there's no denying that. After living for so long I have difficulty remembering it all. 
 
 My earliest memories are of Rome; Christianity was young and the Romans were hell bent on taking over the world. But even in my earliest memory I was already ancient. 
 
 I always knew it would be bad to reveal my enhanced lifespan to anyone else. Humans are greedy and violent, their short lifespans made them lust after immortality and their bumbling attempts at learning about nature resulted in death and destruction for what they studied. I knew that when that hunger turned on me I would wish for death to come and take me. 
 
 But now it was too late. The cat was out of the bag as they say; and I could n't get it back in. 
 
 It used to be simple if someone figured it out; a few slashed throats and a hard ride out of town. A couple of decades later it'd all be forgotten. I had discovered at some point I could enter a hibernation like state that could last decades, even centuries, where I did n't have to eat; or maybe I just ignored the pain of my body eating itself and healing for years on end. 
 
 As the rest of the world got better at travel and communication it became harder for me to dissappear from one life to another; and to destroy any evidence of my immortality should it be discovered. 
 
 When the Internet was first invented I did n't really bother with it. So what if universities across country could communicate data? I already knew so much I did n't see the point of learning more. 
 
 But as time passed and computer technology got smaller and faster I took notice. Already things were difficult what with forensics and telephones and cctv. 
 
 The Internet grew and computers shrank and I began to feel fear. Something I had no true memories of; I knew it was a matter of time until the ever growing Web of surveillance would catch sight of me. All it would take is one video of me rejuvenating after an accident and I would be hunted down by people looking to learn about my abilities. A lesson that would undoubtedly be very unpleasant for me. 
 
 So I used my money to get involved in the growing industries; I had so much of it that I did n't care if an investment did n't pay dividends. I tried to systematically sabotage the growth of the Internet and surveillance networking. But no matter what I tried it was pointless. 
 
 When I heard about camera phones I felt like I was witnessing my own doom. I knew that it would become near impossible to avoid being caught on camera somehow somewhere. 
 
 In the end it was a girl that was my undoing. For some reason I could never walk away from a damsel in distress. I just had to help; even after all these years and all the blood I've splilled I ca n't stand to see a woman in danger. 
 
 I'd been taking a walk to stretch my legs after having spent the last 5 years hibernating in an old crypt preparing for my next transition. As I was walking out of the cemetery lost in my thoughts I was jolted out of my reverie by a distinctly feminine screaming. 
 
 I was moving before I really knew it, following the sound down a nearby street and up a back alley where I could see a woman struggling with a man. She was maybe 20, her golden hair flailing around her head as she thrashed trying to get free of his grip and avoid the gun he was trying to press to her head. 
 
 I grabbed a pebble from the floor as I approached slower, he was facing away from me and his struggles has masked my approach but this close he would hear my foot falls. Taking careful aim I threw the pebble as I charged forward. Hearing my footsteps he spun to the right, the same side he was holding his gun just like I knew he would, the rock struck him in the eye causing him to yell out and flail the gun around in my direction. There was a loud crack followed by a sharp pain in my head. 
 
 The little fucker had shot me. I was certain he'd drop the gun. The little fuc.... 
 
 My vision faded to black and my thoughts slowed the bastard had killed me. I was dying. 
 
 
 ******** 
 
 When I came to next I was in a cold and small box. The morgue. I thought. Brilliant. I tried to figure out if I had been examined yet, a simple toe wiggle revealed a toe tag. 
 
 So I had been tagged and bagged. That means I would already be in the system. Not great but I could still get away, after all a mystery missing corpse is better than discovery. I started to press against the drawer door and managed to get it open and wiggle free. I dropped down and looked up. 
 
 Right at a terrified morgue technician.. With a gun... pointed at me.. 
 
 `` Fuck.'' I say as the gun goes off in the trembling hands of the technician. As my world fades again I can see he's wet himself and has a look of absolute terror on his face. Killed by accident. Great. 
 
 ****** 
 
 When I next wake up I'm not in a drawer. I try to move and feel restraints holding me to the gurney. 
 
 In my chest I feel an unfamiliar rush of ice burn through my veins as my pulse quickens; I start swearing and feel like my stomach had been removed. 
 
 For the first time in my memory I feel fear. I hear a door open and see a man in a simple black suit accompanied by a man in glasses and a white coat. The fear builds inside me. 
 
 `` Subject appears to be awake and alert, commencing questioning'' As the scientist says this the fear blossoms into something more; something primal and ancient. I scream, as my mind plays out all the tortures I would soon be enduring; and started thrashing wildly against my restraints. 
 
 A moment later I'm slipping into darkness still feebly screaming as a dozen tranquilliser darts inject their payload into my body. I feel myself gripped by Hypos and hope I do n't wake. But know I will....

 *rain pours and thunder claps* 
 
 A man sprints across a muddy field. His face was drenched, whether that be from the rain or from his own sweat only god knows. 
 
 Glancing across his shoulder his stomach dropped. 
 In the distance a black figure stood standing still, and though he could n't make out his face, he knew it was him. 
 
 Mike. 
 
 `` Shit shit shit shit, fuck my life.'' he yelled as he sprinted his ass forward. Looking ahead he saw a old house on top of a small hill. If it were any other situation he would where venture near it as it looked straight out of a Jason film but this was not just any situation. Taking one last glance over his shoulder he almost tripped. 
 
 The figure was dashing towards him. 
 
 *Oh i done messed up* He thought to himself. Finally reaching the bottom of the hill, he began to climb his way up, his fingers clawing for a grip. Reaching the top of the hill he glanced down and saw that the figure had got to the bottom. `` FUCK! l he yelled. 
 
 Turning around he saw that there was a fence in between and the house. Building momentum he sprinted and leaped over the fence, barely making it and he continued his dash. 
 
 As he drew nearer he began to regret more and more the decision to come to this house. The doors were old and aged, the windows filled with cobwebs. 
 Lunging onto the patio he smashed his shoulder into the door, and it gave way. He tumbled into the house, and he quickly scrambled to his feet and shut the door behind him. 
 
 As he began to take in his surroundings his blood turned to ice. 
 
 `` oh shit, you have got to be kidding me.'' he said out loud. Right in front of him was a statue of a man. 
 `` the destroyer...'' he said as he examined the statue. 
 `` but if that's the statue then this place must be...'' 
 
 *CRASH* 
 
 The door gave way as the figure burst into the room. 
 
 `` Ca n't run from me anymore kid.'' Mike said with a abnormal grin across his face. As Mike looked at his targets odd expression he glanced at the statue. 
 `` You have got to be shitting me.'' 
 
 *ROOOOOOOAR* 
 
 A thunderous roar came from upstairs as a dark fog engulfed the room. Mike and his target grabbed on to each other as they began to scream. 
 
 `` YOU DARE AND DISTURB MY SLUMBER? YOU ARE FOOLS. I HAVE SLEPT HERE FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS, GREAT GREAT TIMES. NOW YOU COME AND WAKE ME? DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?'' The voice boomed. 
 
 `` YES YOUR THE CREATOR! WERE SORRY!'' The men yelled in unison. 
 
 `` I TOLD YOU LOT TO LEAVE ME ALONE. I MADE YOU ALL BETTER AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?'' The voice boomed. 
 
 The men were lost for words, and to their horror they saw a figure manifest from the fog. It took the form of a man, the destroyer. 
 
 `` Mike WHAT THE HELL are you doing back here!'' The destroyer yelled. 
 
 `` Ever since you left us we all have gone into chaos my lord, and I have had to trade in my past ways to survive!'' Mike said timidly. 
 
 `` MIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT, I AM DISAPPOINTED.'' The destroyer boomed. `` AND WHO ARE YOU?'' He asked Mike's target. 
 
 `` My name is Marcus, but I go by Marco my lord.'' He stammered. 
 
 `` MARCO?'' The destroyer questioned with a chuckle in his voice. 
 
 `` Yes my lord Marco.'' Marco answered in response. 
 
 `` Well then tell me your story LITTLE MARCO.''

","I woke up. My holo-screen lit up to the change in my brain activity. I tried to focus on my schedule. Today was the unveiling of a new frictionless airplane. I was the pilot on the design's maiden flight. It was April 21, 2382. I tried to eat my breakfast but today felt strange. I had felt this way before but today was stronger. I knew what would happen today. The plane would fail and I would crash and die. It's what always happened when I got this feeling. Only today was strange because it felt stronger than usual. I should explain what I mean. 
 
 On August 12 of 1921 I was born. This was the first time. I was born in japan and joined the air force in 1940. In December of 1941 I died, again the first time. I then clearly remember being born, December 8 1941. I told my parents about my memories. They told me that I should keep that kind of talk quiet. Because of them, every time Im born I keep quiet and act like a baby. That way Ill never be committed to any kind of hospital. 
 That was my life. 
 
 I would grow up, sometimes I would have a family, sometimes I was on mars. Where ever I was I would live that persons life. Today was different. I walked to my plane. I knew what was coming, the feeling got stronger and stronger. The thought came to me. It was the same thought that I had every time I died. What did my life mean? I usually went and looked myself up. I always wanted a purpose and I would always try to give some meaning to my life. 
 
 I stepped into the doomed plane. As I took off, I felt the feeling in my gut stop. It always persisted till death, it never just stopped. The controls stuck, the plane dived, and I died in the wreckage. I opened my eyes expecting to see the doctor. I would see him, then my new parents. Eyes full of hope, ready to teach me about the universe, unknowing that I have had dozens of parents, that I could teach them about life, and how things really work. But I was n't in a white delivery room. 
 
 I was in a Japanese aircraft hanger, being shouted at. Language started to come back to me. It had been lifetimes since this old style Japanese was used by anyone. The commander was talking about tomorrows mission to Hawaii. That night, I lay awake. Of all my lifetimes, this one was my greatest regret. I killed hundreds by crashing into the naval ship. I died for a war that would result in my first families death by atomic blast. I died for a country that would lose a war. My death would only mean suffering for others. I would not let that happen this time. I snuck out of my barracks that night. I left all of my duties and honor behind. I escaped. 
 
 The next day I heard about the attack. The war started. I warned people in my home town about the coming attack and managed to get my family and many people out of town. I eventually got into politics and helped rebuild U.S. and Japanese relations. I would promote peace in the world. I do n't know why I was given lives through out the future. Maybe it was to learn about different cultures, or to learn about peace. But I was given my second chance to give my life meaning, and that was the greatest gift Ive ever received.

","A flutter and a snap. With the sound of a loose sail whipped suddenly to capacity lights began to flicker. Candles set like man made constellations prickled across the stone room, their illumination spread in whispering arcs until the room was thick with wicksmoke and hazy light. The smell of mold grew unpleasant. A man in a shimmering, hooded robe stepped from an alcove at the far back of the room. His hands flashed and his mumbles carried a distinct weight. Each syllable seemed increase the odor until it ruptured, dissipating into the remnants of old books and vinyl jackets. At this his voice swelled with innate command,'Step forth. The circle is complete.' From each remaining wall a man emitted. 
 
 The first wore lily-white robes woven with fibers of silk and gold, floral patterns danced and swayed across their breast and sleeves though they be embroidered and the air in the room hung still and fetid. His face was pinched and scored, its topology suggesting a life brutal reserve and consternation. 
 The second, across from the first stepped purposefully from his niche, ornamental boots clacking their metal soles against the cobble. His emerald seemed metallic and somehow iridescent; a lampshade diffusing its internal light. A charcoal sash hung against his leather hunter's pants, fur brimming in the half light. 
 The last to emerge, across from his beckoner approached slowly, with an unsettling ease for his mammoth size and armor, knit from massive plates so dark their seams blurred and shifted. 
 
 The summoner announced after several measures or rest'present the reagents.' At this, in clockwise formation, the man in white withdrew and threw amongst the candles a lock of jet hair. The man in green took from a knapsack a patchwork jacket mottled with various leathers and cast it forth. The candle flames jumped and combined over its surface immolating it instantly. The air in the windowless room began to stir. The spangled flames grew slender and unsettled. The summoners hands flew into archaic and alien patterns.'The final piece.' He half requested half stated. The man in armor unlashed a leather bag from his back. He withdrew, in two massive armloads well over a hundred pounds of wet, seeping clay and laid it in a void between flames. 
 The silence between the men was strained. Each of the three's eyes flickering back and forth from one another's. Only the summoner remains still. His tremulous whisper began to resonate on audible frequencies, hands continuously contorting, their proportions shifting and lengthening. All the candle flames kept a foot in length. One by one, overtaken by a sudden, explosive rapture the other three began casting. Light shifted. Smoke seeped from their knuckles. The gentle wind became by degrees a ripping gust, rotating in a furious cyclone above the flames and clay. Gravity snapped. The men, candles, and clay rose into the air, floating as if dangled from spectral hooks. The flames and candles separated, congealing into two amorphous orbs with the clay forming a third. The wizards words became a synchronized thunder, phrases in Icelandic and Swahili booming abound the crevices as the three spheres began to combine and lose their individual definition. They shaped and formed and distended. The room howled with an almost animate, sinister gale. And with a final incantation, a simultaneous booming `` AYYYYE'' that the spheres were one, the light was dead and the room was silent. 
 Several minutes or many hours passed. Time distorted through the shifting lens of darkness and total, suffocating silence. After a breath or many lifetimes a single, trembled phrase rose from the pitch like a bubble from a lakebed.'.....hello?' It chanced. 
 The wizards cast near identical illumination spells almost entirely by reflex. The room flashed with a newborn sun and in its center lay a pale blinking man, naked save for a leather jacket and messy black hair. 
 The summoner approached and knelt next to the golem, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder.'I'm sorry to have summoned you so suddenly from your plane but there is a powerful necromancer rampaging across the kingdom and you are the only one in history to have defeated him. Will you help us defeat Officer Kirk, The Fonz?' The Fonz looked around the room, gazed at the fantastical clothes and serious faces, took in his own nakedness and saw his appearance reflected in the black armor. He pause for a moment, stood, slicked back his hair and simply stated,'I'll need some jeans a comb and an office.'

","I remember the first time I walked into that room, the warm smell of cinnamon filled the air. Now all I could smell was damp wood and sulfur. The bright red wall splash that I'd once known was blackened by fires that had long come and gone. I could almost sense my Nan sitting at the table in the center of the room with a newspaper and mug of chamomile tea. The last time I'd seen her was long before the war even began, almost 6 years ago. 
 
 Flashbacks of bombs whistling towards the ground were nothing strange to me. When the first bomb had hit I swear you could feel the fear in the air. The collective population of Manhattan holding there breath for those few seconds. Some never to breath again. I'd been `` lucky'' enough to survive those first few weeks of terror. Looking back sometimes I wish that I did n't make it. At least then I would n't have witnessed the things that I did. The screams and tears and death. If only that first bomb had been dropped on my head...

","When they sleep so soundly I realise why I do what I do, those sweet sighs and gentle snores. 
 The movements they make, the night clothes they wear, it brings me joy. 
 
 If you think it ’ s just your paranoia - it isn ’ t. I know your fear, I thrive on it. I watch from the shadows and I watch from the streets, any place or any time you can imagine where I could be… I watch, it is simply what I do. 
 
 My lifespan is a mere three years if I ’ m lucky - not nearly enough to torment someone enough but if you play your cards right and find the time every now and then between watching then, perhaps, you can find a mate. I think then once you have your offspring it ’ s simply a matter of them shadowing you, watching as you watch. It has been said that a shadow can be cast and with it your soul. If the time is right and the moon whispers it I shall like to stay in this hallowed place. This world brings me great joy - three years ( if that ) is not nearly enough to cast my gaze upon my victims and invoke seemingly irrational hysteria. On my deathbed I will try to speak to the earth and see what favours I am granted. 
 
 The trick to the torment is keeping your Mallard eyes on the target without being seen. 
 I have many victims. The days are long but oh so satisfying, I wait for the sweet nectar of fear to ooze from them when they catch a quick glimpse of me. Me - the feathered fiend, shrouded in all your surroundings. I wait, I watch. I calculate. Sometimes I feel as though I am king of this world, Emperor incarnate. My mere three years as your Mallard watcher brings me satisfaction that nothing else can. 
 
 I have had a talking to many times before. The other ducks telling me to slow down on my intake of nightshade and giving me grief and going on about how it is “ doing you no good whatsoever Mal ” blah blah blah. What do they know. The nightshade fuels me, I can see you when I have ingested it. You are my guiding light that will never know you have taken to me to the stars and back. Sometimes I feel no duck understands the true cause - the challenges one must face to overcome the overwhelming desire to be perched atop a human ’ s head sounding the mallard battlecry, unsheathing my feathery sword! I must stop this, it get ’ s me too excited. Short of breath. 
 
 Sometimes I hear my victims talk to themselves and they think they are irrational - they are not. I hear things such as: 
 
 “ I ’ m nuts, they can not possibly be staring at me while I ’ m driving? ” 
 
 I can fly imbecile. I am the Mallard, the watcher. Nature ’ s violent rapist. Untouchable, desecrator of rationality. I thirst for your fear - quench me oh sacred, sacred soul! 
 
 I am the watcher of many - the watcher of few. I am watching you.

The night before you decide you 're going to get rid of him , seeing as how you 've outgrown him , you awake to witness his last stand against the forces that intend to forever corrupt your childhood innocence .
","“ Teddy. ” 
 The word had barely escaped her lips, a whisper in the dark, but suddenly he was there again, awake as if from a decade long slumber. He blinked, and blinked again, and wondered how long it had been since she'd summoned him, called his name. He felt her arms wrapped around his tiny body, his fur, careworn but familiar, nestling against her cheek, and he saw that she was taller now, ever so much older than six, but the way she held him close felt the same. He let her squeeze him closer, and felt the warmth in his heart bloom like he remembered it did nearly every night, so many ages ago. 
 She called him back, after all these years – but why? He had been orphaned, as all the Guardians were by their charges when they came of age. A heavy price for certain, but it had been his honor. He had watched her grow, protected her, carried sword and spear for her in the darkness when only he could, but had he failed? He knew of no Guardians who returned once orphaned, and now as he looked around them, he did not recognize where they were, the familiar bedroom was gone, and he was afraid. 
 There was no time. He felt her breathing slow. She had called for him as she drifted into sleep, and as she did he felt himself pass from her world into the dreamlands, where he knew he would have to do battle for her once again. 
 Lightning rent the shifting skies, and the frail body he inhabited in the human world was gone. The armor chafed his fur, and creaked in the spots where rust had settled in, but he was glad for it. He hefted the shield in his left paw and, with his right, felt the reassuring weight of his sword, Avenger, by his side. Never once had they failed to protect her. They would not fail tonight. 
 “ Teddy? ” 
 Bewildered, he spun around, and there she was. Confusion, fear and happiness danced across her face, and he realized that for the first time, she could see him. 
 “ Lindsay, ” he said. 
 “ Teddy, ” she said. “ Am I dreaming? ” 
 “ Yes, ” Teddy said. “ As we used to dream together, a long time ago. ” 
 “ I thought... ” she said, trailing off. “ I did n't dream anymore. Not after dad was gone. ” 
 He felt a lump grow in his throat, and reflexively massaged an old wound in his side. He remembered the battles from that year, and they were some of the worst. 
 “ You did, Lindsay. You always did. But I was always here for you. ” 
 She embraced him, then, pressing her face against the chipped, gouged steel of his breastplate, and wept. He wrapped his enormous arms around her, and nuzzled the top of her mess of auburn hair. He would always be here for her. 
 “ Teddy, I'm scared, ” she said. “ Scared of... ” 
 Something stirred in the shadows. Teddy saw that they were facing a bluff, nearly at the summit of the rocky cliff, and there was a path into the gorge behind him. Something was coming up that path. 
 “ Lindsay, get behind me, ” Teddy said, and turned to face his enemy. 
 A choking, raspy laugh, thick and syrupy like motor oil, came ringing up the rocky incline, the jingling of bells giving away one of Teddy's oldest adversaries before his pale, sickly form emerged into the moonlight. 
 “ Ser Theodore, ” the skeletal figure said, sycophantically. “ How have you been? ” His raggedy jester's cap quivered and jangled with each step, a black, threadbare cloak enshrouding his sinewy body and, Teddy knew, ten lightning fast, razor sharp claws. “ It's been too long. ” 
 “ Fear, ” Teddy said evenly. He drew himself up to his full, eight-foot height, and laid one paw cautiously on Avenger's hilt. “ I see you never tire of defeat. ” 
 Fear cackled again. “ And you, of your pride, Theo. ” 
 “ I sent you back to the space under the bed how many times? ” Teddy roared. “ Into the crawlspace, the closet, the attic? When you came for her the night before her tonsil surgery, her first day of school? ” He snarled. “ The night you dared move against her with Despair by your side, the last night she saw her father. I cut you in half for that. ” Teddy narrowed his eyes. “ I've beaten you every time. ” 
 Fear's face was a blank mask. 
 “ And now you've come back, ” Teddy said menacingly, “ Because you thought I would be gone, but you're wrong. As long as she calls for me, I'll be standing between you and her. Always. ” 
 “ But it's not me this time, I'm afraid, ” Fear said, almost sadly. “ I almost wish it was, old friend, so that we could dance perhaps one more time. In truth, I'm just the messenger. ” 
 “ Messenger? ” Teddy spat. “ Messenger for who -- ” 
 A light flickered behind him. Teddy turned and saw behind Lindsay's crouched, quivering form, a shining figure hovering just above the edge of the cliff face. He shielded his eyes, trying to make out who or what the figure was. He thought he could almost recognize a face, but it was one he had n't seen in even longer than Lindsay's, since the first time he opened his eyes in the human world, and there was no reason why it would... 
 Teddy's eyes widened. He spun to face Fear, and drew Avenger from its sheath with a roar. 
 “ I'm sorry, my friend, ” Fear said, with genuine sadness this time. “ Today, you lose. ” 
 He wrapped his cloak around himself and vanished. And coming up the path behind him was the monstrosity, a rumbling, shifting mass of smoke and shadows that shook the ground as it careened up toward the bluff, Teddy, and the girl whose innocence he swore his life to protect. 
 “ Teddy? ” she said, and her voice quaked with fear. 
 “ Stay down! ” Teddy shouted. He knew what this was. He had never fought it before, but in his youth, during his training, he had known stories of Guardians who had. They were revered as heroes, every one of them that had faced the demon that now came bearing down on Teddy, and they all fought with courage and ferocity that would become legend. Every one of them failed to protect his charge. Teddy would not fail tonight. 
 Dozens of snaking tendrils exploded out of the roiling mass and slammed against Teddy's shield. Bracing his powerful hind legs, Teddy threw the clawed tentacles sideways and, with a mighty swing of his sword, cleaved them in two. He lowered his shoulder and charged the monster, feinting and parrying with his shield, leveling slashes with Avenger that would have hewn a mountain in half. He found purchase again and again, spilling the creature's black blood on the mountainside, but the beast answered in kind, hooking its whirling claws into the space between Teddy's armor plates and tearing his seams asunder. 
 “ Teddy! ” Lindsay screamed. 
 The desperation in her voice awakened in him a rage more terrible than any he had ever known. He slammed his great shield into the center of the beast's mass and tried to crush it against the rock wall of the pathway. Teddy brought Avenger overhand, ready to plant a killing strike on the monster's head, when in one motion it wrapped its arms around Teddy's shield, ripped it and his left arm away, and threw him backward onto the ground, knocking the wind out of him. 
 And then the beast paused. Teddy scrambled to his feet. Stuffing spilled out of the hole where his left arm used to be, his body was riddled with slashes and something was wrong with his right eye, but none of that mattered. He gripped Avenger tightly in his right paw, its blade stained with the monster's blood and ichor, and he stood fast. Teddy had never failed Lindsay, and he would not fail tonight -- 
 The sound was deafening. When Teddy opened his one good eye, his vision swam, and the great beast seemed to creep up toward the bluff in slow motion. Whatever the monster had done had blown the trees and rocks around it to bits. Teddy looked down. One leg was hanging by a thread, the other was gone. Avenger's hilt was sticking out of his chest. 
 He had managed to shield Lindsay from the worst of it, but she had been knocked unconscious by the blast. Gritting his teeth, Teddy crawled slowly toward her. If this was the end, the monster would have to tear him apart before it laid a single cursed finger on her. Teddy reached Lindsay's prone body and, with his last ounce of strength, laid himself gently over her to protect her. But the beast took virtually no notice. Teddy watched as it rolled slowly by, giving the briefest pause to acknowledge his broken body feebly shielding hers, and marched upward, toward the shining figure at the cliff's edge. 
 And suddenly, Teddy knew. How naïve he had been. And how completely and utterly he had failed. The beast reached up and enveloped the shining figure, and everything slipped into blackness. 
 “ Lindsay? ” 
 A voice, and Lindsay stirred. Teddy blinked. He was back in his small body, and Lindsay's eyes opened slowly. He could no longer move, and so could only see where she pointed him. He was pointed at a sign on the wall of the room they were in, lit by harsh fluorescent light. 
 It said, “ Family Waiting Room. ” 
 “ Aunt Sarah? ” Lindsay said, her voice shaking. 
 Teddy could n't see Aunt Sarah from where he was, but he did n't need to. Please no, Teddy thought. But he already knew. 
 “ Your mommy's gone, baby, ” Aunt Sarah said. “ I'm so, so sorry. ” 
 And Teddy felt all of Lindsay's sixteen years fall apart, felt his heart break, felt her put him down on the chair and saw her throw herself into her Aunt Sarah's arms and cry, cry, cry. Teddy saw the box of photographs and keepsakes on the table amidst the empty coffee cups and spent tissues, the one in which he had lived for the past ten years, the one from which she had brought him forth, brought him here so that he might have a chance to protect her, one last time. But it was not to be. Teddy had protected her from Fear, from Despair, from the armies of the Unknown in days gone by. But as her innocence had slipped through his fingers, Teddy had finally learned the great beast's name, and learned bitterly that he could not protect her from Fate. He could no longer be her Guardian, and would only watch as they both raced headlong toward their own destinies. 
 Lindsay and her Teddy. 
 Orphans.

","The slowly rising light of the dawn was broken into orange fragments by the surface of the water. It was almost hard to look at, the constant shifting and glinting forcing me to squint my eyes. I could n't look away though, there was something so beautiful about it. Even though I had sat on this very same bench and watched the same sun rise hundred's of times, each one was perfectly unique. The ripples of the tide, refracting the soft light in a completely distinct pattern. 
 
 `` Sup fucker,'' the raspy voice behind me startled me out of my reverie. `` You look like some kind of goddamn doe-eyed protagonist of a rom-com or something, sitting here staring wistfully out at the sunrise.'' 
 
 `` You Sam are a total asshole you know that?'' I handed her a coffee from the tray next to me as she took a seat on the bench. `` Just a cynic to the bone you know?'' 
 
 `` I prefer realist, pragmatic even.'' She sipped the still hot beverage as she joined me in looking out across the water of the bay. `` Shit if I did n't knock you down a peg every once in a while you would just be floating around with your head in the clouds chasing perfect girl after perfect girl.'' 
 
 I just sipped my coffee quietly; I could n't really argue with her. I had known Sam almost my whole life. We had been neighbors when we were kids, and our parent's were friends so that meant we saw a lot of each other. She was one of the few people in the world I felt I could really be honest with. 
 
 `` So, who was it this time?'' 
 
 `` What? I do n't know what you mean,'' I lied. 
 
 `` Come on dude, I am not completely dense, I know the drill by now. The only time you want to hang out here is when you are having girl trouble, and that seems to be more and more often lately.'' She crossed her legs on the bench and turned to face me, the light breeze blew the stray brown hairs that were bundled up in her messy bun into her face but she did n't seem to mind. `` So come one, spill the beans, give me all the gory details.'' 
 
 `` Well, I guess there is something... It's Jamie, we broke up,'' I said. 
 
 `` Not surprising.'' 
 
 `` What? What the hell is that supposed to mean?'' I asked, indignant. 
 
 `` Exactly what it sounds like. I knew this was going to happen.'' She shrugged and took another sip of coffee. 
 
 `` Alright fine, I'll bite,'' I said slightly peeved. `` How did you know this was going to happen?'' 
 
 `` Well for one, she was too perfect for you.'' She hunched forward a little, clearly into this analysis, `` Let's see, she liked video games and old Kung Fu movies, she was an amazing cook, and she has hiked and camped more than you have!'' 
 
 `` You really are n't making this sound like a problem... or making me feel any better for that matter.'' 
 
 `` She was too perfect and you know what happens when you are with a girl like that? You get bored.'' She shrugged again as if she had just made an irrefutable argument. 
 
 `` See here is where your whole case falls apart though, she broke up with me! If I was really bored with her I would have just ended it before we invested so much time together.'' 
 
 `` Oh she still loves you dude, I can guarantee she did n't want to break up with you.'' She paused a moment before continuing, `` You know what your real problem is? You are too fuckin nice. She was perfect for you, and you realized it. I mean shit all we talked about for the first six months you guys were dating was her!'' I nodded stupidly, still too numb to figure out where she was going with this. 
 
 `` Then you settled into a routine, you started spending even more time with her. She was practically living at your place! That is when it happens, you start to crave something, something exciting, something new. Every time you see a girl you know at work or in a restaurant your mind starts to wander. You start thinking what if?'' She paused and let that sink in. I could n't deny it, but was n't that natural? 
 
 `` And to be honest man, you ca n't be blamed for it. You are smart, handsome, have a good job, and most importantly you are confident without being an asshole. Somehow it seems like very chick in this town is a perfect match for you, who can blame you if you start to wonder a little bit about new possibilities.'' 
 
 `` But I loved her,'' I said weakly. 
 
 `` I know you did buddy, but sometimes love is n't everything, and sometimes it bursts at the seams. She saw it, she saw that you had more love to give than she could handle on her own. I am sure it broke her heart to do it, but I think she was trying to make you happy by setting you free.'' 
 
 `` That is fucked up...'' I could n't think of anything else to say. 
 
 `` Think about it this way. When have you been the most happy in your life? When you lived with Trisha and were thinking about asking her to marry you? When you and Gabby went on that Peace Corps stint together? When you took Jamie on that backpacking trip through the Sierra's?'' She paused, `` Or was it when you first met them. That first moment of infatuation. The first time you had sex with them and it blew your mind and you thought nothing could ever be that good again? That first moment that you told them that they loved them and they told you they felt the same way, but they had been waiting for you to say it first so you did n't think they were crazy?'' 
 
 `` I... I do n't even know what to say...'' It was true, I did n't. I felt like I had just been put under a microscope completely naked and then been poked and prodded with a bright light shining in my eyes the whole time. She was completely right. What was wrong with me? 
 
 `` Hey man, I do n't mean to fuck you up, but I know you. I have known you forever and been through all of these relationships with you. I think maybe you are too obsessed with finding the one when there might not be a one. Maybe there are a thousand or a million people who are right for you. At some point you got ta make a choice. Love is n't some lighting strike, it is a slow burn.'' 
 
 I looked at Sam and realized she was right. How had I not seen it before? The one person who truly understood me, who knew my ins and outs, was sitting right in front of me. I watched the wind play lazily with her hair, and saw how the soft light of the dawn highlighted the angles of her face. She was beautiful, I guess I had always known that, but she had never been more beautiful than she was right now. I wrapped my arm around her shoulders and leaned forward... 
 
 `` ACK! Dude what the FUCK!'' Sam thrust her hand between my lips and hers blocking my clumsy attempt at a kiss and shoving my face violently away. My ears immediately burned as all the blood rushed to my face in a violent blush. 
 
 `` I-I'm sorry, I do n't know what came over me, I thought...'' 
 
 `` Well ya thought wrong dipshit!'' She yelled. She looked genuinely angry for a few moments before she broke down into a hysterical fit of laughter. `` Hahaha, dude you got some issues man. I am gon na give you a pass on that one because you are in a sensitive emotional state right now, but seriously do not try some shit like that again.'' 
 
 I began to laugh at my own stupidity as well. `` Ok I think I can make that promise. God I am such an idiot, I feel like I just need a break.'' 
 
 `` Ya know that is the best idea you have had in a long time. Take some time to yourself, learn a new hobby, go on a trip or something.'' 
 
 `` I might just do that.'' I finished my coffee and checked my watch. `` See I knew I did the right thing in calling you. You always manage to make me feel better somehow, even when you tear my guts out in the process.'' 
 
 She flashed me an impish grin, `` Hey that's what friends are for.'' 
 
 `` Well, I got ta head to work. Let's do something later though, that new horror flick came out today right?'' 
 
 `` Oh yeah Final Destination 10, it looks like a real piece of shit. Let's go!'' 
 
 `` Alright cool, I will hit you up when I am off.'' We waved goodbye as I headed off towards the subway station. I had barely made it two hundred yards when a stunning raven-haired woman who was jogging by stopped in her tracks and looked at me. 
 
 `` Mike? Holy shit!'' She came over and threw her arms around me. Her smell was intoxicating, she had been running and sweating but it was still somehow sweet and pleasant. She pressed her body into mine for a few seconds longer than I expected. `` Oh my god, I am so sorry, I'm disgusting! I am just so surprised to see you!'' 
 
 `` Haha, do n't worry about it, I am surprised too,'' I smiled. `` What are you doing here? Do you live here now?'' 
 
 `` Yeah my work opened up an office here and they wanted me to move out here and take over as director of the new location.'' 
 
 `` Wow congratulations!'' 
 
 `` I have been so busy, I almost completely forgot that you lived here too, but it really is great to see you!'' We both paused for a moment just looking into each other's eyes intently. 
 
 `` Listen, I uhhh,'' She began. `` I am not really sure how to say this, but I have thought about you a lot. About that night in Bermuda. This is going to sound crazy but, it meant a lot to me. If you wa n't I... I would love to hang out with you some time, you know catch up.'' 
 
 `` Listen Simone, that night meant a lot to me too...'' I hesitated, and almost caved, but I though about what Sam had said. `` I just, I went through a really bad breakup recently and I feel like I really need to spend some time on myself right now.'' 
 
 `` Oh, okay. I totally understand, and I am sorry to hear that.'' She was visibly disappointed and a little piece of me was crying out in protest. 
 
 `` It really is great to see you though, and we will definitely catch up soon,'' I smiles weakly. 
 
 `` Yeah, good to see you too.'' She hugged me again and jogged off in the direction she was going. 
 
 I continued on to the subway, feeling better than I had in a long time.

","*Today is the day. * 
 
 A tall, broadshouldered figure enters slowly from the back hallway. Impeccably dressed, the figure sported an impressive navy blue suit, a crisp, bright white shirt, and a tie redder than the blood of his enemies. 
 
 The figure ponders. He stares incessantly at his feet while they slap onto the large checkerboard patterns that made up the floor below. 
 
 One two. Three... Four. 
 One two. Three... Four. 
 One two. Three... Four. 
 One. 
 
 The figure stops as he nears the end of the walkway. Putting his hand into his pocket, he fondles a coin in his hand. While only objectively worth $ 10, the coin meant infinitely more to him than a complete set of state quarters. 
 
 Suddenly, a semikempt young woman rushes in from outside the corridor. 
 
 `` Mr. President, it is almost time for you to go on.'' 
 
 `` Thank you, Charlie. How much time do I have left?'' The figure takes in some deep breaths. 
 
 In. 
 Out. 
 In. 
 Out. 
 
 But it never seems to make much of a difference. The anger and self pity never go away. The apprehension eats away at his inside like a cage of carnivorous butterflies. 
 
 `` Five minutes, sir. I will wave you on when it's time.'' 
 
 Charlie was normally a very attractive intern, but everybody was on edge today, considering the circumstances. It was 3AM. Nobody was prepared. Everybody was a mess. 
 
 `` Much obliged. Thanks for being ready to go.'' 
 
 The president had a wife. Wild. Caring. Strong-willed. Passionate. A stubborn pacifist. But she was definitely not a morning person. Her morning hair was as silky smooth as a Tesla coil, her morning breath as strong as a thousand ships. Despite her imperfections, he loved her. 
 
 It was a shame that she was dead. 
 
 Charlie motions to the President. He looks up from his feet and confidently strides to the podium. He waves to an enthusiastic young girl that he imagines in the crowd. She would have been 8. 
 
 `` Good morning America. Good day world.'' 
 
 `` Today is the day that we have all been dreading. Half an hour ago, I received some very disturbing news. The rebel government of the Russian Martian colony has... annihilated New New York. In minutes the Russian rebels will have taken over the Red Planet.'' 
 
 He pulled the gold bullion from his pocket. It had been specially modified as a gift for his wife. An old unwanted Melania $ 10 Spouse coin, transformed into a work of beauty. 
 
 While the harsh lines of coinage were certainly not kind to the portrait, the portrait of his wife reforged onto the coin warmed his spirits and strengthened his resolve. 
 
 `` When I last spoke with my wife and daughter, they had just entered New New York. It was lovely. So many precious lives have been lost. This day shall lie in infamy.'' 
 
 `` With this coin, in the honor of my family and all of the families of the victims of this heinous evil, I ask that Congress declare war on Russia and Mars.''

252235,"[ IP ] Slum Town ...
","The sun was just setting between the valleys of the massive structures that rose up all around the shacks. A few people shambled back from their days scavenging, scouring, and searching for food, materials, and supplies. 
 
 The current buildings had just been built two weeks prior. The nearly 3 dozen inhabitants had migrated from their previous location after being driven out by the construction droids in preparation for the construction of a new spire. They were used to such moves, living a nearly nomadic life due to the constant construction of the city around them. 
 
 Coruscant was one huge city from pole to pole, climate controlled and temperature moderated by an array of orbital mirrors that kept the entire planet at a comfortable temperature. Over thousands of years of building, the entire planet was essentially seated upon hundreds of meters of old buildings and abandoned structures that served as the foundations for the towering skyscrapers and towers that made up the skyline. 
 
 Metal, duracrete, and other building materials were shipped in from across the galaxy to form as the raw materials from which the armies of construction droids built more and more to accommodate the ever increasing population. The droids were programmed to carry out the construction through any means possible, including paving over houses, possessions, and people that got in the way. 
 
 In the lower city, the law was scarce and nearly non-present. It was a common occurrence in such city-planets for the undercity and the upper city to become almost separate entities, completely cut off from each other. Nobody cared enough to venture down in the the stinking, seething depths of the bowels of the planet when they could live perfectly happy lives up on the metal edifices above. 
 
 The inhabitants of the depths made their living off of the refuse of those above, sorting through the heaps of discarded trash and other trash that collected everywhere. The trash was everywhere - the entire lower city was practically one big landfill. Organic waste, parts of buildings, toxic byproducts, they were all dumped or dropped from above into the dark, unseen depths. Occasionally, treasures were found among the rubble; communicators, power cells, and packaged food made up the most prized of the findings. 
 
 As the people continued to slowly filter back into the shacks and huts, a strange noise was heard in the distance. Despite the hundreds of billions of beings, ships, and droids that hovered above them, the undercity was usually very quite, save for the occasional landslide or building collapse. 
 
 The sound was a low, deep noise that sounded like a strong wind blowing in the distance. As one by one the people of the compound turned their eyes to the sky, trying to find the source of the loud sound among the crags of metal and marred buildings, it suddenly became fearfully clear. From over the top of a hill of rubble came a ship, heading for the ground at high speed. White smoke trailed from one of its engines, and its right wing appeared to be pockmarked with holes. 
 
 The people ran in desperation, dragging themselves over mounds of trash in a desperate attempt to escape from the massive object plummeting from the sky. Before most of them had even cleared the perimeter, however, the ship struck the base of a valley and with a surprisingly muffled shock embedded itself into the trash, setting off small collapses and landslides around the area. 
 
 Once the smoke cleared and the trash settled, the people crept back and stared. After a few seconds, however, a commotion was started among them and they ran together towards the broken buildings that surrounded the area, desperate to get away from what they had just seen: the royal Imperial emblem marked in blood red across the rear of the craft.

","`` *The Archduke is safe! *'' The man exclaimed as he strode confidently out of my kitchen and onto my garden patio, tripping over a case of Guinness Extra Cold and almost knocking the sausages off our sizzling barbecue. After regaining his balance and some of his dignity, he looked at the three of us. `` This is n't the Institute!'' He looked like he'd just come off the set of Jeeves and Wooster, with his old fashioned Edwardian-style clothing and mutton chop sideburns. 
 
 
 `` You've got the wrong house, lad,'' Dad kindly explained.

 `` Yes! Get me on the line with the director of the Temporal Editing Institute immediately, it's very important. His name's...'' He broke off as he saw our mystified expressions. 
 
 
 `` There's no Ten Pearl Anything Institute'round here mate,'' Dad told him. 
 
 
 `` *Temporal. * As in *time. * You've really never heard of it?'' 
 
 
 `` No idea what you're on about. Look, why do n't you have a sit down, my wife'll make you a cup of tea, wo n't you love?'' 
 
 
 `` *Course* I will,'' Mum cooed. `` And then you can tell us all about your... *Institute. *'' The last word was said with such transparent pity that it was clear Mum expected this'Institute' to come and pop this loony back into a nice comfy straitjacket. The mysterious stranger replaced his pocket watch and sat down at our table with a sigh, as though suddenly very tired. My parents can have that effect. Mum went into the kitchen and our guest told us his story. 
 
 
 `` It's the year 2015, is n't it?'' 
 
 
 `` Aye. Has been for a while, now.'' 
 
 
 `` And this is... Abbeydale, in Sheffield?'' 
 
 
 `` That's right. Got lost on the way to the party, did you?'' 
 
 
 `` Something like that. I was on a mission.'' 
 
 
 `` To the off license?'' ( Dad's snide implication brought a disapproving `` *Frank! *'' from Mum, who was standing in the kitchen doorway waiting for the kettle to boil. ) 
 
 
 `` To the year 1914. My mission was to stop agents of The Black Hand from killing the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and triggering The Great War. In the original timeline they ambushed the motorcade by throwing a bomb in the Archduke's car. With the help of the Institute, I was able to go back and quietly deflect the bomb and, this time around, the Archduke escaped the explosion.'' 
 
 
 `` How *awful! *'' Mum said. `` Was anyone hurt?'' 
 
 
 `` Go put the *tea* on, Daisy!'' Dad ordered. Mum dutifully shuffled back into the kitchen muttering to herself. I took a gulp from my pint of Guinness and decided to show off my boundless knowledge of world history. 
 
 
 `` Archduke Franz Ferdinand? He's that guy who got assassinated before the first world war, is n't he Dad?'' Dad nodded, pretending he also knew about history. 
 
 
 `` So I failed,'' Our time traveller lamented. `` The Black Hand must have had other agents in Sarajevo and succeeded in a second attempt. *Damn! * And without the Institute there's no way of going back. *Wait* a second...'' The man's eyes grew wide. `` What do you mean, *first* world war?''

","`` Watch out for ice!'' I hollered to the bundled little girl as she ran headlong though the snow, leaving behind footprints on the path and her voice in the cold, night air. 
 
 `` Oh let her be,'' said the voice at my side, affectionately squeezing my arm as her head lazily fell onto my shoulder. 
 
 I sighed before turning to face her, wrapping her woolen hands in my own. My lips pressed against her forehead, just below her hat. Her face was flush. A ripple of envy shivered down my back as I wondered if it had been me or the cold? She leaned up and kissed me, and I felt foolish at once. 
 
 The footfalls and laughter had stopped. I looked sideways to see our daughter standing in the middle of the path, a short distance away, her neck craned as she caught snowflakes in her mouth. 
 
 We resumed our languished walking, hand in hand. 
 
 `` Must you leave tomorrow?'' she said quietly. 
 
 `` I must,'' my voice droned. As we approached, our daughter abruptly faced us, giggling before falling onto the ground. Her arms and legs swept back and forth as an angel appeared on the path. `` I'll be back before the holiday.'' 
 
 `` You could say no.'' 
 
 `` I could lose my job.'' 
 
 `` Would that be so bad?'' 
 
 `` Would you still love me if we were poor.'' 
 
 `` I'd still love you if you had no job, no money, no arms, or no legs.'' 
 
 She stopped moving as we grew closer, her eyes staring up towards the sky. 
 
 `` Yes, but would she?'' 
 
 `` She, she would understand.'' 
 
 `` No she would n't,'' I said wearily. `` I know what it's like.'' 
 
 `` Not everyone is like you.'' 
 
 `` And how much better we all are for it,'' I met her cross face with a crooked smile. 
 
 She opened her mouth to speak, but a high voice nearby broke in, `` I'm cold!'' 
 
 I turned, taking a few long strides before hoisting our daughter into the air. `` Well of course you're cold silly, you're laying on the ground!'' She blocked half-heartedly my kisses with her glove hand. `` Ew,'' I said, `` your nose is all runny!'' 
 
 Placing her down, I pulled a handkerchief from my breast pocket as our daughter replied, `` Well it's your fault. I told you I needed a new coat.'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry sweetheart. Maybe when daddy gets back from his trip.'' 
 
 I took the handkerchief back as her mother caught up. `` Come on, let's get back inside and I'll fix you some hot chocolate,'' she said. Taking our daughter's hand, she led her homeward along the path. 
 
 `` No she would n't,'' I said to myself.

 He did n't say anything. He just looked at her. 
 
 `` Oh Seth.'' She began, and then stopped as a myriad of emotions enveloped her. 
 
 `` Why did n't you show me this back then?'' 
 
 `` I could n't. I knew you had to go. And I had to let you go.'' He replied.

 She looked at Seth and slowly shook her head.

 Seth said nothing, he just returned the smile and reached to touch her hand. But she was n't ready. She withdrew quickly and pushed back in her chair. 
 
 After a few moments she lent forward again. Her fingers found the box and she began leafing through the movie stubs. They were creased and discoloured, but you could still read the dull ink print on most of them. As she read stub after stub, the tears started again. 
 
 She fished one stub from the box and held it up. She hesitated as she made sense of the faded and smudged ink through the kaleidoscope of tears. As the years melted away, the memories appeared. Like dusty furniture in a long unused house, they were still there, waiting to be uncovered. 
 
 The tears stopped as the memories shed their shrouds. A broad smile sneaked, unnoticed, on to her face. She realised and looked at Seth. 
 
 `` You know what I'm smiling at do n't you?'' She asked. 
 
 `` Of course I do.'' Seth laughed. 
 
 `` My dad still regales strangers with that anecdote.'' She said.

","There's not much to scrape by with in a rural Scottish hamlet. Still, the gentle plinklings of change in the town treasury still gets a rise out of this ancient frame of mine. I have to say I'm quite surprised these *peasants* can spare anything at all. The blacksmith works his hands raw for nearly nothing. Hmm, makes it all the sweeter I suppose. 
 
 
 Shame though, that I'd be limited to possessing such tiny souls here, in this dump. Inhabiting the Mayor was comfortable, but he does n't have much longer for this world. Thankfully it does not take much to convince his constituents that my administration was entitled to a portion of all their wages. A remarkably simple con really; give me your money, or else. This was a much more satisfactory arrangement than my time with the Highwayman. 
 
 
 My thoughts are cut short as I feel the Mayor taken by another coughing fit. I need to advance my arrangements. 
 
 
 Hmm, a younger body is needed for sure. Sadly, youth and wealth are so often mutually exclusive, particularly in this town. Damn this town. The people are hardly distinguishable from the environment; cold, graying, sad, shrubs planted in substandard soil. No opportunity here, no great oaks. Weeds grew rampant, sipping life from one another, giving nothing. 
 
 
 My ruminating was interrupted by an uncharacteristically chipper clattering. One of the local boys skipping along the cobbles. He was holding a wad of bills, more money than a boy his age could have gotten hold of reasonably. 
 
 
 `` Slow down, boy. Who'd you steal THAT from? ``, I pointed to the cash. 
 
 `` Nobody! I saved it, my Dad gave me some too! ``, his reply. 
 
 `` Nonsense, why are you strolling around with that?'' 
 
 `` My family is headed to the harbor. We're moving - it's for tickets.'' 
 
 I was not devoid of some jealousy for him, `` And where would that be, boy?'' 
 
 He smiled, `` Ammmmerica''. 
 
 I too recalled the romanticized skyline of New York City, albeit sadly. `` You ca n't make it there, you'll always be small.'' 
 
 `` Maybe, but the best I'll make ever make it here is just another you. `` 
 
 The truth was like a hammer. As little more than a king of dirt farmers I paused bearing the weight of the realization. 
 
 `` Maybe you're right, boy'', I sighed reaching into my pocket. I pulled out my largest bill, and concentrated on it's face with intention. `` Take this for your hard work, I wish I had it.''

","He was numb. 
 
 All he had ever known was gone. His brothers in faith lay dead at his feet, and yet he could feel nothing but pity for himself. Pity for the last survivor of this ancient order. Pity for a man lost without the guidance of the elders. Pity for a coward. 
 
 He had fought, lined up shoulder to shoulder with the men he had known his entire life. Their glares pointed forward, unwavering at the sight of the enemy. At the sound of the command he had pulled up his shield in formation, and yet he knew deep down he was still a coward. For when his shield went up, an uncontrollable shaking came with it. His friend, his brother, Cal had gently put his on the man's shoulder. That had soothed the shaking, but yet still all the man could feel was fear. Not fear for his own life, but for the fear of the welfare of those all around him. He did not think he could cope with even one of them dying. 
 
 And yet here he stood, alive, with all those he had feared for dead on the ground. He looked down at the terror this battle had caused, down at the faces of the family he would never see again. He tried to make himself shed a tear, a single tear, in honor of those lost. But he could not make the sadness come forth. 
 
 Instead in the place of the numbness, of his fear, of his sadness, a new emotion appeared. Rage. The ones who had done this, the ones who had brought war to his homeland, they had survived this battle and they moved onward towards the capital. His newfound rage only allowed him to do one thing, *Fight*. 
 
 The Elders had always taught that it was our duty to protect this kingdom and all of it's inhabitants. He and all of his order had thus far failed in this duty, the sacred calling they had all spent their lives working for. He was not going to let those years, those sacrifices, be wasted. 
 
 The enemies had to be stopped and the kingdom had to be saved. He was the last of his order, and thus he must carry on the oath they each had sworn. He kneeled down, saying one last goodbye to Cal. He took Cal's amulet as a token of their brotherhood, and then he stood up a man with a purpose.

217772,"[ WP ] Returning home , you find that your guardian angels have decided to stage an intervention for you .
","Walking in to my house I knew something was awry. Three unicorns parked outside my house, eating my grass, and shitting all over my yard. My front door, which leads directly to my living room, was unlocked, welcoming me to another boring couple of hours in what I call'my life'. `` Honey, I'm home!'' I shout sarcastically. Three angels sitting in my living room - their faces painted eager. `` Sit down, Mitchell. We have much to discuss.'' 
 
 This has happened before. These three bores turn up like clockwork trying to get me to alter my lifestyle. A lifestyle I very much enjoy, I should add. Angel Clive, one of the first angels to ever take an interest in me, removes a large slab of stone from the inside of his robe and holds it high above his head like Link finding a sword for the first time. A small red dot appears on the stone pointing towards the first inscription:'I am the Lord thy God.' It's Dave the Angel with his laser pen. 
 
 `` First thing's first, I'm the realest.'' exclaims Dave, much to the enjoyment of the other angels. `` You know, like Iggy Azalea? It's like Iggy Azalea, Mitchell.'' 
 
 Welcome, everybody. This is the reality of having Guardian Angels. 
 
 `` As you know by now, rule # 1 must always be announced and understood before proceedings can, well, proceed. God is life. God is eternal. God is love.'' All three angels gently sweep the floor with their right hand, make a cross on their chests, kiss their fingers and point towards the sky. Every sportsman has got this spot on by the way. I have no idea how. 
 
 The laser pointer moves down. `` # 2, Mitchell.'Thou shalt have no other gods before me'. We have gone through this before so why do you still insist on calling yourself the'God of Mario Karts'? 
 
 `` Pick up that pad and I'll show you'' 
 
 Angel John motioned to pick up the pad. He always does. He's like that one friend who, even though he knows he is going to be beaten in to furious rage, he will always play. 
 
 `` Angel John, no! His Rainbow Road game is too strong, we have been witness to this in the past. Whilst we acknowledge your prowess we must insist you drop the'God' title from your nickname. It says right here on this large slab of stone that you are n't allowed to do that. Do I require a larger laser pointer?'' 
 
 `` I'm not dropping the God moniker until John over there picks up the pad and beats me'' 
 
 Angel John instantly goes for the pad. `` JOHN, I SAID NO!'' bellows Angel Dave. 
 
 The laser pointer shoots down to the inscription'Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy'. `` May I ask, Mitchell, just how have you been keeping the sabbath day holy?'' 
 
 `` I have n't. I'm not even sure how to keep the sabbath day holy.'' 
 
 `` He's not sure how to keep the sabbath day holy. Angel Clive, enlighten Mitchell for me, please'' 
 
 Angel Clive, still holding the heavy slab of stone above his head, looked a little puzzled. `` Well, on the seventh day God rested. Which was good. So I rest too. Bit of Playstation 4 and just pig out. I really like the HD remake of The Last of Us.'' 
 
 Angel Dave looked bemused. `` Are you fucking kidding, Angel Clive?'' Yes the Last of Us HD remake was very, very good but we are n't here to discuss Playstation 4. We're here to make Mitchell a better person. Just start keeping the sabbath day holy. Go to church or something. MOVING ON.'' 
 
 Out of the corner of my eye I can see John now has hold of the GameCube pad he was denied earlier on. `` I know you can hear me, Mitchell. I'm a fucking Angel. Telepathy is one of my many talents. I'm going to wreck you on Karts the second this farce of an intervention finishes. I'll be playing the harp for the final lap such will be the magnitude of my destruction. Eternal damnation via the power of red shells..'' 
 
 Angel Dave interrupts ``.. Angel John, we can all hear everything you're saying to Mitchell telepathically. We are Angels too. We have identical powers. He beats you every time you play him.'' 
 
 “ This time will be different ” 
 
 “ It ’ s never different, Angel John. You play, you get beat, you say the game is fake and then go home.'' 
 
 `` I do n't want to hold the slab anymore'' admits Angel Clive. 
 
 `` You see what you have caused, Angel John? Now Angel Clive does n't want to hold the slab anymore. Can you remember how long it took us to convince him to hold the slab?'' 
 
 `` I just want one shot at him on Rainbow Road.'' adamantly states Angel John. 
 
 `` Fine. Boot the GameCube up. But after the God of Karts beats you we are going through the Commandments again.''

But , a single infringement on one of the 10 commandments would remove this power . However , the resistance now have their own Paladin .
","''He's here.'' The look on the knight's face spoke for itself. 
 
 The man reached for his golden helmet, laying beside him on a wooden table, covered by a tablecloth stitched in golden thread,''sine peccato'' reflected by the light of the chandelier above it. As he stood up, he put the helm on his head and grabbed his sword. 
 
''Should I call the others?'' the knight asked. 
 
 The paladin shook his head, his well kept beard and mustache waving along with his movement. 
 
 With his golden armor he treaded down the marble stairs, marching by the pictures of every paladin before him, his metal boots resounding in the high ceiling of the church. Forty-nine pictures later, forty-nine men and women of great honor, he reached the end of the hallway and put his hands on the reinforced door. He pushed. 
 
 The doors swung open, their heaviness screeching in protest to the quick movement. The Paladin marched towards the large banquet table filling most of the room, it's mahogany engraved richness radiating an extravagant aura through the room. Thick chairs of the same material, covered in soft, crimson pillow gave room for twenty noble Paladin. The Paladins gave up their freedom to serve the Holy Light and its sacred mission. Alissar, the 50th Paladin, came to a halt. 
 
 A slim man, covered in thin black leather armor sat on his seat at the head of the table. It was the first time Alissar laid his eyes on him, and it was not what he expected. He had heard the stories, but the man seemed not a problem for him or his order. His presence emitted no strength, no power. No threat. 
 
 The order was founded one-hundred and twelve years ago. The first Paladin, Alwin, had found the perfect balance in his life, cleansing himself from all negative influences and perfecting the following of the ten commandments. He received divine power and the mission to establish a world where the commandments were written law and each individual that not followed its word religiously, would be forced to better their lives. 
 
''Why are you here?'' was all Alissar asked as he pulled back the chair at the other head of the table. Instead of sitting down he rested his palms on the table, leaning forward in anticipation of an answer. 
 
 The man finally looked at him, meeting his gaze. His thin lips formed a mischievous smile.''You know, you really have a security problem.'' His voice was almost silk, yet still powerful. A voice that appealed to reason. Emotion. Feelings. A sudden unrest grew in the Paladin. The words resembled those he heard many years ago. 
 
 The Paladin smirked and waved his hand in a dismissive gesture.''There's only a security problem if you impose a threat. Which you do not. Your arrogance has preceded your arrival. You claim many things, yet we know, as our order, that none of the things you say hold value. We control the entities of light, and darkness flees where light arrives.'' 
 
 Alissar had earned his power the day he reached down in the chamber of sacrifice and knelt down in the puddle of cleansed water and swore his vows. He had arisen anew, his destiny paved out for him. And yet again, the voice of the man in front of him reminded him of that day. 
 
''Ah, of course.'' He dramatically raised his hands.''Not a threat to the church, obviously not. You have established a mighty and powerful structure, that no one can harm, no one can touch. Yet, here I am. You know of me, you know of what I say, yet you deny because you do not want to believe. Maybe you are not as powerful or as righteous as you think you are?'' 
 
''There is only one righteous path.'' Alissar responded. 
 
''A path that will force you to keep your enemies alive? A destiny that cuts paths of freedom until one is left. A path only there to serve itself. Make no mistake. This..'' as he gestured his hand around the room,''is all for you. Your order.'' 
 
''We serve the one true god.'' the bearded Paladin replied back.''We have seen the Presence, we have seen the Path that was layed out for us. All of those who oppose that path will be dealt with. Retribution will be swift, the punishment of your resurgence divine.'' 
 
 The man smiled again as he slowly rose from his chair.''Your god... your god is puny. He is futile. But most... most of all... he is wrong.'' 
 
''Your blasphemy will be your demise.'' Alissar stated as he too rose from the heavy chair. He lifted his sword and summoned a golden shield, gold light radiating through the room. 
 
''Your ignorance will be yours. No other gods? Your lord has grown mad. How dare he ignore all others, once brothers and sisters?'' The man spat his words out in anger.''His selfish claims will be accounted for. I stand before you, as one of the Gods, to exercise judgement.'' And as his last word left his mouth, he jumped on the table.''Let's see how true your path is, Paladin.'' he spoke, as with a whirl of his hands he created a thick shadow hovering around him, covering his silhoutte.''I'm coming for you!'' he yelled to the ceiling, a sword of thick smoke appearing in his hand as he raced forward. The shadow shot forward, crashing down the golden barrier of the Paladin. Alissar braced himself.

","Look, sometimes life just takes a shit in your cereal, ok? 
 
 That's a saying I have. I came up with it after taking a shit in a bowl of trix. It's a long, painful story. Brings up a lot of bad memories, so naturally, I wo n't be talking about it. In an unrelated tangent, fuck Susan. 
 
 Right, where was I? Shit trix? Good. 
 
 I'm an IT professional, working for the Airforce. My job is to go around and fix the goddamn idiotic mistakes that the average person makes with highly sensitive technology. I spend most of my days resetting passwords, putting out literal and figurative fires, and teaching five star generals how to BCC emails. Naturally, I'm an alcoholic. 
 
 Well, I mean. Let's blame my Dad for that. And Susan. But let's not get into that rabbit hole right now. Facts are: I work for the military. I'm a tech guy. And I'm drunk like 80 percent of the time. Yes that includes sleeping schedules. 
 
 And the team that was working on the MK1 - Ares exosuit was inexplicably torn to shreds after a coincidental meeting with the AI team. You know, as inexplicable as the tides. No one knows how that works, I'm pretty sure. 
 
 Regardless, the whole laboratory was firebombed, then exploded, then *finally* cut from the powergrid. When all was said and done, we were down two teams of research nerds. 
 
 And the public reveal was scheduled for the following day. 
 
 So, when Mr. Five Star I do n't know how to open a fucking.pdf document decides that any old nerd will do, and hey, is n't that Jimmy fellow good with computers; should n't we use him? 
 
 Well. That's when you find yourself strapped into a burnt, sticky, slightly blood soaked exo-suit. Of course, the guys who did the work were actually, legitimately good at their jobs. Left documentation, user manuals, and all that fun stuff. I never had to interact with them, and that shot those poor dead idiots miles up in my line of respect. At least they could figure out how to turn something off and on again. Well, except when they could n't. 
 
 Hence why I'm in a suit that has literally eviscerated it's previous creators and pilots. Hence why I'm ( figuratively ) shitting myself, waiting for the power to be turned on, beating my fears into submission with 100 proof conscious killing rye whiskey. 
 
 You know, when you're trapped in uncomfortable straps, surrounded by metal, some blood, and most likely the psychic residue of broken dreams, disappointment, and sudden but inevitable betrayal, your mind tends to wander.

 Ok. 
 
 It was more like a chug. And it was n't my only flask. 
 
 So when the curtains dropped, and I felt power surge to the MK1-Ares, I could n't be entirely blamed for what happened next. I mean, it was the probably the rogue AI that forced me to yell out a name and charge forward into the middle of the press core. 
 
 Honestly, some one should have warned them they were in the splash zone. Ca n't blame me. I also could not be blamed for the structural, physical, and emotional damaged inflicted on those around me. Indeed, I am also blameless for the way my arm tore through a couple of Abram tanks, and how in a slightly discoordinated stupor I crab walked over a legion of innocent civilians.

 They saved us. We do not know why, they would not say. With a thousand voices, they would not say. A thousand voices, one word only. On every channel, over every comm, they called to us, guided us. 
 `` **Home, **'' they called to us, `` **Home. Home. Home. **'' The ones that could not follow, the ships too crippled by debris or radiation or mutiny, they gathered them into their great arms with all the gentleness of a mother cradling their baby. 
 They delivered us to our new home, our Eden. And then they slept. They did not ask for our allegiance, or faith. We give it anyway. 
 
 For we know the bastard thieves, our great foe, still dwell on our first world. It will not sustain them, greed will force them to seek out other worlds to ravage and plunder. So we prepare.

I nodded to her, she seemed to know what I was suggesting. 
 
 I stood still for a moment, the guards around me stopped as well and started yelling for me to keep pace. I grinned and lifted my hand. A soldier to my left suddenly drew his gun and fired 3 rounds into my chest. Maybe they knew who I was after all, but they certainly did n't know how to fight one of the horsemen. I flicked my wrist and a guard flew up against a wall. I twisted my arm and his spine did the same.

The Muslims wer n't too happy, but they adapted pretty quickly too, Allah is forgiving, Allah is merciful, but Allah is not blind to bad behavior. and again the sects that decided they knew better, continued to think they knew better, the christians, the jews the muslims, all had groups that rejected it. but with the flashy way of the reveal, it was kind of hard to deny.

 When his Most Supremely Beautiful daughter had inherited the leadership of the world, everyone had expected civilization to instead be governed by her advisors.... But that was n't what had happened. There was, instead, a literal 8 year old girl - well, a 10 year old now, but still every bit as insufferable - governing the whole world.

 Content that it was finally, completely cooled, he put his gloves on and picked it up, not wanting the warmth or moisture of his hands to reach its surface any more than was completely necessary. 
 
 It was exquisite. A more finely crafted thing, he had never possessed. The delightful, colorful swirls about its hard-boiled surface. They practically begged to be slurped on, and indeed, he could feel his salivary glands wanting urging him to indulge in it. 
 
 Carrying it from the kitchen, he made his way upstairs, to the grandest room in his house. Priceless works of art covered every wall of the huge room, but he did n't have appreciation for any of them as much as had for what he held in his hand. `` I made a new one. The biggest yet!'' He said cheerfully, his niece lounging on her bed infront him - this was her room now, after all.

 He charged in towards the demon lord, using all of his strength. The demon lord's eyes widened for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure. 
 
 `` You fool! I've been terrorizing the entire world, and you think that is enough to defeat me?!'' 
 
 Of course, he did n't know about the heroes secret spell. The hero grinned, and ran right into the demon lord's sword. 
 
 Blood started dripping from his stomach, and he looked up at the demon lord with a look of confusion. 
 
 `` How.. could this.. happen?'' 
 
 The demon sword pulled back his sword, and the hero fell limply to the ground. There was now doubt that he was dead. 
 
. 
 
. 
 
. 
 
 WHAT?! 
 
 YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DIE HERE!! YOU HAD A SECRET SPELL PREPARED TO DEFEAT THE DEMON LORD!! WHY DID N'T YOU USE IT?! 
 
 Oh sorry, just got a little surprised there. I guess I'll need to find a new hero to follow, considering that the previous one was incompetent. 
 
 Me? No, I could never be a hero. Not that I would mind, I just do n't have what it takes. I doubt I could last more than five minutes against the demon lord. 
 
 Wait, why are you pulling out a knife and pointing it toward me? And why do you have a spare set of armor and weapons with you? Wait, did you predict that this would happen? But why me? And why are n't you giving me a choice? 
 
 Oh, we do n't have time for the whole refusing the call ordeal? Well, if I do n't have any choice, I guess I'll go. 
 
 ***** 
 
 On the way to the demon lord's castle, I met many companions, and got many followers. People referred to me as'the narrator', as I knew the secrets of every character I met. And after half-a-year of traveling, I finally arrived at the gates of the demon lord's castle. When I arrived, I turned to my companions and spoke. 
 
 `` Sorry, but I ca n't have you follow me any further.'' 
 
 As expected this was met with protests. Still, since I knew that the castle is surrounded by an area spell that slowly drives the people inside insane, I did n't really see any other option. I had seen the previous hero's companions slowly go insane, and the hero had only gotten by because the hero is granted immunity to mind spells. 
 
 I do not have that advantage, considering that I'm not a hero. If I were to guess how long I could hold out, I would say at least 30 minutes, and an hour at maximum. 
 
 Still facing my companions, I took out a scroll and pointed the side with the text towards my companions. And then I teared it into two. 
 
 A huge wall of earth shot up in front of me, separating me from my companions. With that, I turned around, and headed into the castle. 
 
 ***** 
 
 Castle makes it sound like a really big facility, but the only two rooms that really mattered was the throne room and the room next to it. 
 
 The previous hero's party had cleared out everything, and for some reason, the demon lord had n't bothered getting new guards. If I were to guess, I'd say that he got some elite guards, and he did n't have much money after investing in them, so he skimped out on regular guards. Typical demon lord arrogance. 
 
 Still, it gave me a good chance to check over my equipment. I had my armor and sword, and I'd become decent at using them. In addition, I had three'arrow hell' spells, two'acceleration' spells, and one'inferno' spell. They were all scrolls, as I had no natural magical ability. When I entered, I had also activated a clock spell that showed me how long I'd been inside. It currently said 04:49. 
 
 As I turned the last corner before the throne room, I saw a figure in front of me. I recognized the shadow instantly. It was obvious why the demon lord had n't bothered to hire any extra guards. After all, he had the best fighter in the land. 
 
 It was the hero. A demon lord using necromancy should n't surprise anyone, so in retrospect, I should n't have been caught off-guard. 
 
 In the time I was shocked, the hero had already charged and swung his sword. He was aiming for a gap in my armor at my left shoulder. I tried to bring up my sword to block, but I realized that it would n't be quick enough. Instead, I took a sidestep to the left and received it with my helm. Definitely not my best idea, but it was better than starting to bleed before I faced the demon king. 
 
 I took one of my'acceleration' scrolls and used it to send myself backwards, and away from the hero. It ended with me crashing into a wall, but I was barely able to stay conscious. I really should n't try to be a hero. 
 
 I saw the hero coming towards me, but I cast'arrow hell' while breathing heavily to keep the hero preoccupied. 
 
 I used the small recovery period to process the situation. I had used two of six spells, and recieved some bad damage in the process. The clock also said 17:23, so I should probably try to avoid this fight. 
 
 Having gathered my thoughts, I activated another'arrow hell' to send arrows towards the hero, and to force him in towards the wall on the left side. Once he reached the wall, I cast another'arrow hell', to force him into the corner the furthest away from the throne room. 
 
 Once he was there I cast my last'acceleration' to speed past him and into the throne room. I remember the feeling of having outwitted the hero, even if said hero was dead. Well, I was actually outwitted by him. 
 
 ``'FORCE MOVE''' 
 
 Right. The hero's trump card, that he for some reason did n't use against the demon lord. One of the most powerful spells in existence, since it can force a person to do anything, except for killing themselves. Right in front of the door to the throne room, I turned around and charged towards the hero. 
 
 While I was holding my sword in both hands above my head, the hero put his sword in front of him, making sure I would collide with it. Kind of funny if you think about it. I'd die the same way as the hero, a reckless charge into the enemy's sword. 
 
 Like hell I would let that happen. I had intended to use it against the demon lord, but beggars ca n't be choosers. I shouted with all my strength. 
 
 ``'INFERNO''' 
 
 Fire engulfed the entire room. Normally, the flames would only fly from the part of the scroll that contains writing, but since the scroll was rolled up, it flew in every direction. 
 
 The end result was a burnt hero falling to the ground. I did of course not escape unharmed, but I had prepared some fire resistant clothing, considering that I was dealing with fire spells. 
 
 The clock said 25:32. 
 
 Not much time left. 
 
 I had less than five minutes to defeat the strongest creature known to man. In addition, I was covered in wounds from the previous battle. 
 
 Those were my thoughts as I stumbled through the gate to the throne room.

 He knew this because of the title: `` The Book''. It was unambiguous, Stan had to admit, but there was a certain charm about it. Fingering the spine lightly, Stan levered the cover open. Inside was the musty smell of old papyrus and - strangely - rose petals. The pages were ancient and crumbly, and Stan feared they would fall apart in his hands. 
 
 The first several pages were blank. Stand considered a chance leafing of the pages, but wisely decided against it when a well timed but minuscule tear appeared in the page he was turning. Painstakingly, Stan carefully flipped each blank page until at last he found writing. 
 
 `` The Oldest Trick'' was written in a large, unassuming font about 1/3rd of the way down the page. The ink was a faded black, with possible hints of dark red. Was it blood? Stan thought not, but the notion was intriguing. 
 
 About 4 inches underneath the pages title was some even more faded scrawlings. They were hastily written, and so faint that Stan had to lean in slightly to read them. 
 
 With his nose inches from the book, Stan read the archaic words. A sudden understanding flooded him, and the hair on the back of his neck stood up. Things started to come together in his head. How could he be so stupid before. The name of `` The Book'', the page titled `` The Oldest Trick'', and the content. 
 
 Just as Stan finished digesting all this information, he felt a tap on his left shoulder. As if in slow motion, Stan turned his head to the left to see who was bothering him in this moment of clarity. As he did so, Stan's arms prickled and he began to feel very uncomfortable.

 **Villian: ** Miami Ice 
 
 **Motivation: ** Homestake Mining Company 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 Birmingham Athletics walked down the dusted trail towards the Homestake Mining Company. An old mineshaft carved out of the foothills of the old desert visible only by a mile away before the dust storms blocked it from view. He ’ d been this way before, many times. The last time almost left him for dead with a concussion that rang hotter than the Mohave. Miami Ice could have killed him, but he probably just wanted to play with him. 
 
 “ Birmingham Althetics, what do I owe this pleasure? ” a voice rang out through the dust. Ice was just a few yards away from him, standing on the porch of his old house scratching curse words into the walls with a large buck knife. 
 
 “ I came for whats mine, Ice, ” Birmingham said. 
 
 Miami Ice shook his head and stabbed the knife into the wall next to the door. He whipped around opening the left side of his jacket to show Birmingham the butt of his pistol. Birmingham rested his hand next to his own side arm and studied the movements of Ice. 
 
 “ I thought I told you the last time I whipped the tar out of you. This company was procured fair and square. Now if you were a man of your word you ’ d turn tail, count your losses and move on with life. It ’ s a fact of life son. If you don ’ t pay your bills you wind up on the street. ” 
 
 Birmingham saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Of course Ice wouldn ’ t be foolish enough to have a fair fight. The henchmen were carrying various weapons, a mixture of found goods, pieces of glass, and barbed wire, which they displayed proudly for Birmingham to see. He could easily pop a few off with his pistol, but they ’ d overpower him in a heartbeat and take him down. 
 
 “ Now I ’ ve been fair to you, ” Miami Ice said walking down the steps toward Birmingham, “ but I ’ m losing my patience. This will be the last time I let you live. Go on boy. Find yourself a new life. ” 
 
 Memories flashed through Birmingham ’ s mind. He remembered the garden out back that went into disrepair. He remembered the wrinkled lines in his grandfather ’ s face and the laughter from when he told a story. He remembered the smell of the pies from the kitchen. What he didn ’ t remember was ever giving this bastard permission to touch foot on his land. Birmingham was a man of honor, and his honor had been tested. He wasn ’ t about to turn yellow. 
 
 “ Draw, ” he said with a grin. 
 
 Miami Ice was not amused. He curled his lip and hawked a loogie onto the ground that turned to steam in the desert heat. 
 
 “ Ten paces, ” Miami said, “ then I ’ ll blow yer head off. ” 
 
 They stood back to back and Miami called out the numbers. At one they took a step and Birmingham ’ s heart raced. On two he could feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins. His fingers danced above his gun in anticipation. On three he began to think of death, right before a loud crash of a fired weapon rang in his ears and a sharp pain tore through the right side of his chest. He touched the open wound and looked at the newly pooled blood. Of course, he thought to himself through the shock, never trust a bastard. 
 
 Birmingham whipped around as he felt the air sucked out of his lung. He almost fell over from the pain. Ice tried to empty the rest of his weapon into Birmingham, but the gun jammed. The bastard didn ’ t even take a pace. 
 
 Birmingham raised his weapon and shot back. The bullet whipped into Ice ’ s shoulder knocking the weapon out of his hand onto the ground. Ice grabbed the wound and yelled to the other members of his gang for support. He would not get any help. They threw their weapons on the ground and turned away. They may have been criminals and vigilantes, but they had respect for the rules of the draw. Birmingham shot a second time. It crashed into the side of Ice ’ s cheek sending him backwards into the dirt. He struggled to yell to his comrades, but the words only came out in gargled spits of blood. Holding his pistol in a shaking blood covered hand, Birmingham emptied the rest of the chambers until Ice was unrecognizable, even to his mother. The adrenaline kicked off and he collapsed forward into the dirt. The blood loss from his wound was severe and his vision was blurring. The voice of his grandfather rang softly in his ear. It was comforting and rhythmic, he could smell the pies on the windowsill. He struggled up to his feet and moved forward towards the house. The voices were getting louder, warm and welcoming. He pushed through the door of the house and for a brief moment saw it exactly as he remembered it. Back before the bank foreclosed on the property, back before the dust came in and washed away the green, back before Ice had kicked them all out tearing their family apart. Birmingham laid down on the cool wooden floors and felt the world get smaller. A wrinkled hand reached down and touched his, he grabbed it.

 He glanced up at the digital clock: 3:01 PM. 
 
 `` Hey, James, you left your radio on WMAS.'' 
 
 James looked up at the clock. `` You're kidding.'' 
 
 `` They're loud and clear.'' Alan turned the volume up. 
 
 `` -- THREE ONE. EIGHT THREE ZERO SIX SIX...'' 
 
 James whistled in admiration, amazement. `` There's no way they're on the main grid. Why the hell are n't they transmitting an emergency broadcast?'' 
 
 The wheels started turning in Alan's head. `` Every broadcaster in the United States is required to serve the public interest. That's the law.'' 
 
 `` I guess, I mean, yeah...?'' 
 
 `` I do n't consider The Numbers to be in the public interest when there's a category one hurricane on top of us, would you?'' 
 
 `` What about it?'' 
 
 `` I say we go over to WMAS and broadcast from their facility.'' 
 
 `` Woah, woah, woah --!'' 
 
 `` -- We can take your Jeep, it's got all-wheel drive, does n't it?'' 
 
 James held up his hands. `` Number one --'' 
 
 `` -- come on! --'' 
 
 `` -- NUMBER ONE, `` James raised his voice over Alan's, `` -- it's a hundred miles to Amherst and as you pointed out we're in the middle of a hurricane. Number Two: I'm pretty sure this is a hell of a lot more about your own interest than the public interest. Number Three: I do n't wan na go. I'm not interested anymore, and I think you're one of the last people trying to chase this thing down. And Number Four, I do n't think you would have a chance in hell of getting away with it.'' 
 
 Alan mulled over his own thoughts. 
 
 He had been real gung-ho about figuring out what happened to WMAS. He had the little show on WGBH, and then the Company Man took it away. He kept up with a little snooper group that met in the Sanders Cafe, and watched its numbers dwindle from the dozens to the handful, to the one. He remembered when he told Mrs. Sanders that he would n't be back the next week; she took his hand and told him thank you. 
 
 He had filed all of the requests for information that he could; they were consistently ignored. He even conned an electrical engineer at MIT to analyze the WMAS signal, telling him he was setting up for a special spot on the radio; the engineer found nothing, and it was Alan ignoring his calls, until they stopped after a few weeks. 
 
 And every once in a while, always when it was after dark, he'd see a big Ford sedan in the parking lot of his apartment, car window cracked and the smell of smoke in the air, that would drive away the moment Alan looked in its direction. 
 
 `` Hell yes, this is about my interest. This is our chance. No one is going to be out in the middle of a hurricane, not even the Army or the CIA or the Roswell Aliens.'' 
 
 James reached into his pocket, and fiddled with his keys, tossing just one key to Alan. `` If they catch you, I'm saying you stole it.'' 
 
 Alan gave the key a little kiss. `` I owe you one.'' 
 
 `` No, you do n't. I'll cover for you here, in case we get power again, but it looks like that is n't going to be anytime soon. Good luck.'' 
 
 * * * 
 
 He was grateful that he had actually made it. Driving in a hurricane was one of the worst things he had ever done to himself. But the prize was before him: he was all alone with WMAS in front of him. 
 
 Alan had stopped at home for his bolt-cutters; maybe he had known that it would come to this, eventually. The wind pushed him hard and whipped the gate open, the cut chain falling on the soaked ground. The radio station was past the edge of town, so he did n't bother pulling the gate shut; the station was the only thing on the little spur off of the main road. 
 
 He drove right up to the front door of the old station, and his bolt-cutters again made quick work of the two padlocks. He pushed on the door. But it was locked. 
 
 How had that slipped his mind? Of course the main door would have a regular lock. He lifted up his bolt cutters, and wondered if they would somehow be able to chew through the door... and then he remembered. 
 
 He pulled out his keys, and on the ring was his old WMAS key. No one knew he had one, except for his old boss who gave it to him off the books, `` in case of trouble.'' 
 
 He slid it into the lock. And to his amazement, it turned. The door swung open easily, now. 
 
 It was just like he left it. Chairs left in the exact same spots. He walked past the little breakroom; the fridge was still propped open, empty. The air smelled stale, and the hurricane whipped outside, his steps echoing in the hall and his breath quick. Into the broadcast center, under the lit ON AIR light. 
 
 THIS IS WMAS AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS -- 
 
 He jumped. The announcement startled him. He whispered along as he looked around his old booth. 
 
 ``.... by three nine four one one nine eight Ontario, incorporated, Canada, and broadcasting twenty four hours a day on the eff see see assigned frequency of ninety-one point one megacycles at... five thousand...'' 
 
 The sound of the door opening and closing behind him was soft but he was tuned to it, especially as the sound of the wind bled into the otherwise sound-proofed space. 
 
 `` Step away from that tape deck.'' 
 
 Alan turned around, slowly, but he stood in his place. 
 
 The Company Man stood at the other end of the short room. His hand was behind his back. 
 
 `` The meek shall inherit the earth, Mister Anderson,'' he said in that raspy low voice of his. 
 
 His hand came out. He was holding a revolver. 
 
 ``... but only after the taxman gets his cut.'' 
 
 Alan did the only thing he could think to do, the one thing he thought the Company Man came to stop him from doing. 
 
 SEVEN SIX FOUR TWO ZERO. 
 
 Alan hit the eject button on the 8-track as hard as he could with his fist.

 The tape launched out of the deck and skittered across the floor. 
 
 For the first time in two years WMAS was silent.

","I did n't recognize him, at first; though I had certainly seen him before. A lifetime ago, when my hair was fair, my eyes still clear and strong. 
 
 
 I turned from the window, from the sterile view in those sterile rooms. He just stood there, perched so casually upon the wall, but there was nothing in the lush gardens of the home even half as beautiful as him. I had never seen anyone so handsome; not even my beloved Richard, the morning of our wedding day. 
 
 
 My left hand tightened around my walker, but my right went to tighten the straps of my gown. 
 
 
 “ I would have dressed, if I'd known you were coming. ” 
 
 
 He just smiled at me, this black-eyed, raven-haired Adonis. Heavily-lashed eyes did not blink, only regarded me with eternal tranquility. 
 
 
 My walker's squeaky wheels creaked as I pushed my way toward a chair. I glanced at him and patted the seat beside me. 
 
 
 He seemed surprised. Black eyebrows rose, and in my prime, I might have had a reaction to the gesture in those perfectly sculpted features, those full lips in a face distinguished by its high cheekbones. 
 
 
 He moved languidly, with a feline grace in that perfectly tailored suit. He might have been going to a funeral, I thought, and a dark humor perked the corners of my lips. 
 
 
 He sat next to me, and he did not protest when my wrinkled hand landed over his. 
 
 
 I closed my eyes. The sun was just an hour before rising, and I could hear the growing music of the birds as their chirps began, lazy and recalcitrant in the dim atmosphere of the early dawn. In the back of my mind, I registered his fingers curling around my own. 
 
 
 “ That was you, was n't it? ” My voice was soft, no longer ringing with youth, but weary, thick with age and use. “ When Billy went. ” 
 
 
 I felt the weight of his stare on me, and I turned to meet his gaze. I'm not ashamed to admit my breath did hitch, this time, when my eyes met his; I felt I would drown in those fathomless pools. 
 
 
 “ It was. ” 
 
 
 His voice deep, blacker and thicker than the darkest of ink, and its unearthly tone raised the hairs on the back of my neck. 
 
 
 But I knew it was him, the day we lost Billy. He was only four years old, but the leukemia had ravaged his tiny body, decimating it of the glow and vitality that should have been the claim of any child. 
 
 
 Death had looked different, then, when he came to take my little boy. Not the caricature with the scythe and robe, of course, but different, dangerous, and sinister. 
 
 
 “ Are you ready? ” he asked. 
 
 
 I looked around the spartan walls of my room in the nursing home. My dulled eyes went to my nightstand, the only segment of that space that was truly my own. 
 
 
 I saw the pictures of Richard, my friends and parents, and in the back, a tiny yellowed square, of the only child I had borne and lost. 
 
 
 All gone. All having lapped and passed me in the track of life. 
 
 
 “ Yes, ” I said, turning now to smile at Death. “ I am ready. ” 
 
 
 He stood, then, all broad shoulders and long limbs, and eased me up beside him. He took both my hands in his and his dark eyes captured mine. A cool pulse radiated between us, and the breath in my lungs was cut short, abbreviated at the end of my life. 
 
 
 I opened my eyes, and to my surprise, I saw my body still there, sitting in the chair, immobilized and lifeless, a puppet whose strings had been snapped. 
 
 
 I looked down at my hands, no longer frail and spotted, but firm, and strong, and pale with a glow not dissimilar to Death's. 
 
 
 The world faded around us, but I could still see Him, clearly, his eyes never wavering, always affixed on mine. 
 
 
 He smiled, then. “ Are you ready to see them? ” 
 
 
 “ Yes, ” I said, almost laughing with joy. “ Yes, I am. ”

 `` I do n't know what you're getting at.'' The prisoner snapped. 
 
 The black man took off his glasses and placed them in the front pocket of his shiny blue shirt. 
 
 `` You have been in and out of prison all your life, you have this one chance to redeem yourself, you would do a great honor for your country if you do this. You could be a hero. Please, give us the access code.''

The corrupt precinct burnt his house down with them in it to dispose of the evidence. The last thing he had now was the access code and he would be damned to give it to them. He stared deeply in the man's eyes across from him. `` Never.'' He said. 
 
 The man looked across to the other police officer with a handlebar mustache and nodded. The police officer opened the heavy gray door and three men came in with clubs, bats, and tire irons. 
 
 Jack's eyes widened. `` You monsters!'' 
 
 One man grabbed a blindfold and placed it over his own face. The others did the same. `` Why are they all blind folding themselves?!?'' Jack questioned.

248641,"[ WP ] After too many ridiculous and lengthy lawsuits dominate the world 's courts , the world leaders decided to pass a law to remove all warning labels . The Darwin Act has just been passed .
","“ The Darwin Act, ” Mack thought, “ how stupid! ” 
 
 “ Sir? I can help you here. ” 
 
 Mack looked up from his phone ’ s screen and saw the barista motioning him over. He stepped up, placed his order, and was handed a tall cup of piping hot coffee. As he grabbed it Mack looked at the lid. Blank. No worries, holding the side of the cup told him all he needed to know – the stuff inside was hot. 
 
 The Duty to Act Responsibly Without Individual Notice Act, colloquially known as the Darwin Act, had passed after a bitter fight. The alignment of the various pro and con groups, however, surprised many. Most surprising might have been the so-called “ Trial Lawyers. ” Proponents of the Act openly acknowledged that one significant objective was the elimination of “ ridiculous and lengthy ” lawsuits brought by Trial Lawyers. Yet the Trial Lawyers simply sat this one out ( though the group did refer to it as the “ Law of Unintended Consequences ” ). 
 
 Reaching his office Mack sat down at his desk and pulled out his yogurt. In contrast to the coffee cup lid, this lid was unchanged. It still showed a date beyond which consumption was not recommended ( this one was good for another three weeks ). 
 
 Mack remembered the fighting that took place over food labels after the Darwin Act had passed. The Act itself comprised all of one page. As originally proposed it was seventeen pages, but was pared down significantly as one group or another took issue with various parts. Ironically, a large section that quoted from “ On The Origin of Species ” had to be completely removed along with any reference to the work. At bottom, it meant that the contours of the Act would be left to regulations and the courts. 
 
 On food labeling, some proponents argued that a pure interpretation of the Act meant expiration type labels were a form of “ warning label ” and therefore must be excised. One public interest group, the self-styled “ Naturally Selected, ” observed that when the Constitution was written, James Madison would have been personally responsible for deciding whether the food on his table was fit for consumption. Ultimately, that position was rejected. ( In yet another surprise, it was the food companies themselves that opposed that view. They strongly supported having “ throw out ” dates on their products. ) 
 
 The day passed quickly, as it always did for Mack. He loved his work and he was always busy. Even so, he couldn ’ t help but notice all of the “ non-warning ” labels around the office. The Act had not just eliminated such labels going forward, but to “ level the playing field ” mandated that existing labels be removed. In many instances the labels were not tags or stickers, but were molded into the product itself. Compliance in such cases meant a sticker covering the warning. Hence, while Mack had little desire to poke his fingers into the spinning blades of his desk fan, the blank gray sticker covering the warning inevitably reminded him of the warning itself. Mack sighed. 
 
 Returning home, Mack went to his garage to continue with his woodworking project. Wearing his ear and eye protection while working the table saw, he didn ’ t notice his ten year old son Karl come up next to him. Mack was momentarily distracted as he saw Karl ’ s hand reach up to the saw tabletop. Karl dropped an item on the top with a clatter as Mack turned off the saw. 
 
 “ Mom says you need to listen to this, ” Karl directed, pointing to the CD. 
 
 “ OK, I will, ” Mack replied. Karl didn ’ t move. Damn demanding kid. Since Mack enjoyed music, it was his job to listen to all new CDs in case there was language on it that Mack and his spouse thought inappropriate for little ears. Fortunately, there were parts of his project that Mack could attend to without ear protection. 
 
 “ OK, I ’ ll do it now. ” With that reassurance, Karl turned and went back into the house. Mack switched on the player. It happened to be on the radio setting, and was broadcasting a news report. 
 
 “ The head of the Naturally Selected has died in what is being called a freak accident. He was hiking with friends in an area that, unknown to the group, was littered with abandoned mines. The area was unmarked, and there was no warning... ”

220076,"[ WP ] An odd meteor falls into your home country and from the rock emerge a horde of alien locusts . Surrounding countries and the UN quickly wall the borders , effectively isolating your home from the world . 30 years later , it 's a strange no man 's land ...
","Carl Jackson had dreaded this moment since he first heard of his assignment three months ago. He was to be the first man past the wall in thirty years. He knew of the devastation that had followed the arrival of the Europa-born bugs. 
 
 Drones had been unsuccessful in photographing the landscape through the ash layer beneath the clouds, nor had the land rovers collected imagery much farther than 10ft, thanks to the dense fog that rolled over the dusty plains. 
 
 The well-wishes Carl had received, from both family and government dignitaries were the last thing on his mind as he put on the suit that had been engineered for him. The atmosphere had changed radically outside of the human commune. 
 Before he knew it he'd been placed in the excursion chamber. He'd been psyching himself up all week, but when the hatch opened, he had never felt less ready. 
 
 The hydraulic pistons hissed as they extended, opening the hatch. It was not long before the fog started rolling into the chamber. Fear flooded through him like cooling liquid, but something about the fog was actually inviting. 
 
 The external world, unseen for thirty years, was his to explore. Surely with nothing left to consume, the bugs must all be long dead. Carl unbuckled himself and clumped in his heavy boots towards the door. 
 
 It was deathly quiet. As expected, Carl could see almost nothing. He wandered for a few minutes, trying desperately to maintain a bearing, careful with his steps. The last thing he wanted was to step on something that would alert anything to his presence. 
 
 After a short while, something in fog. Something standing about 7ft. It looked a little like a tree. Carl stopped in his tracks, and peered at it. It did n't move. He looked harder. Could it be a tree? If it were, it would mean everything. After all this time, had vegetation prevailed? If there are trees there can still be life. The earth could be restored. 
 
 Carl took a few more steps, his heartbeat was bounding around in his chest like an excitable puppy in a box. His steps broke into strides. Until he stopped... 
 
 The'thing' was not a tree. It was a thing. A thing with its back turned to Carl. 
 
 `` Carl...'' spoke the thing. `` Look around...'' 
 
 Carl did n't know what to do. Should he run? Is it a person? It can speak, but its so tall. What else was out here. 
 
 `` Carl, I can hear every word your thinking. For God's sake man, if you've got a question to ask just bloody well come out and ask it. God! You humans are so pathetic. You paralyse with fear so fucking quickly.'' 
 
 Carl was paralysed with fear. 
 
 `` No-no, we do n't'', stuttered Carl. 
 
 `` Carl... move your left arm.'' uttered the thing indignantly. 
 
 Carl could n't. It was blindingly obvious that the thing was very much more aware of both itself and himself than Carl was. 
 
 `` Carl, who are-'' 
 
 `` Oh come on, use your brain! Carl, I mean... what are we doing here?!'' 
 
 `` Are you one of the alien-locust things?'' 
 
 `` Thank heavens! The man is not such a dullard as we all came to think! Kalloo Kallay! Hope! Hope for us all, after all...'' mocked the thing, clapping together two tendrils, as it turned to face the little man. `` If only your people had used such initiative 30 years ago. We'd not be standing in such a desert.'' 
 
 `` You created the desert! You lot swept across the globe consuming everything!'' 
 
 The thing tensed and flickered its wings from beneath its rugged elytra. 
 `` No! Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Wrong, wrong, wrong!!!! We came from that meteorite in which we travelled in two waves! Two distinct waves!! The first, you moron, was a scouting party. Some consumed a little, you'd expect as much after a 240 year journey on a drifting meteorite, but the second, the second wave were diplomats! Diplomats you dim creatures were too petrified to even open up communications with! Every other planet we've every visited, has opened up a welcoming committee and we have discussed our intentions and our motives and agreeable situations were met everywhere! Everywhere but here, here, you all ran away, barricaded yourselves in, and left us here with increasingly little food. Now the planet is a wasteland, and its all because of you lot.'' 
 
 `` People have never experienced alien life. We have no idea what to expect.'' 
 
 `` You know what we never experienced!? Sugar cane. No where else in the galaxy can you get sugar cane. Nothing like it has ever grown anywhere in the history of the universe, but do we all flee in terror, do we take our young in our arms and leave the sugar cane without proper irrigation and leave it to wither in the dust outside?!'' 
 
 `` Well, sugar cane can grow on it own...'' 
 
 `` Ok, bad metaphor, bad metaphor... I'm sorry, I'm terribly uhh... Our people are all but dead. Coming here... we hoped, would be a real...'' The thing shuffled uncomfortably, visibly becoming emotional, ``... a real'step forward' for the Cransynthotoa... But it depended on talks. We had a strong population but no knowledge of your planets agricultural methods. We have outconsumed supply, aside from a few small areas of forest, but not because that was ever our intention. And now it is so that our colony is doomed.''. The enormous creature sunk into himself. 
 
 `` Why did n't you come and approach us?'' inquired Carl. 
 
 `` You barricaded yourself in with young children. We did not come here to terrify younglings.'' 
 
 `` Would it not have been worth it to save your people. We did n't even know you were so developed'' 
 
 `` It is not up to us to decide what is, or what is not, appropriate to do at the cost of other's young. Only the parents have the right to decide that. We decided as a unit, to wait to be approached. It has cost us everything, but our sense of what is right and what is wrong.'' 
 
 `` How many of you are left?'' 
 
 `` We are a hive mind. A collective consciousness. But only one voice remains when I reach out to the network. My own. Like echoes in a cavern. All others are lost.'' 
 
 The sincerity of the creature, isolated and lost on a dusty plain, was enough to tear any mans heart to ribbons. 
 
 `` You're certain you're the only one left?'' Inquired Carl, careful to be sensitive to the creature. 
 
 `` It is certain.'' 
 
 `` Good.'' said Carl. And he shot the creature dead. 
 
 `` Kzzz... Carl, how're you doing?'' It was the communications system in the suit. It was mission control. Carl toggled the mic from a handy toggle in his glove. 
 
 `` It's all cool, I've quashed the alien race!'' reported Carl cheerily. 
 
 `` Seriously?!'' bleeped mission control. 
 
 `` Yup, honestly, come out! There are some trees left with which we can repopulate the planet!'' 
 
 `` Kzz... Jolly good, pop back to base and come join us for a cup of tea and a Jaffa Cake! We'll repopulate the earth in the morning!... over!'' 
 
 `` Will do!''

 `` Test, test.'' I speak in a deep voice. The man I am sitting inside wears an old fashioned suit. Possibly early 1800's then? I'll have to remember this when I get back to my time period. Maybe I can change the mechanics so my body can return with me next time, rather then taking over another man's mind? Surely the- 
 
 `` Are you alright sir?''

 `` Sir, your itinerary?'' the man reaches forward, holding out a coarse paper. 
 
 My body feels weak and frail. Whoever I took over is some sort of giant though, I tower over the other man. I take the paper in my hand and gasp. All day long I have speaking appointments. Clearly I am an orator of some importance. 
 
 `` Mr. President, are you ready to get going?'' The man says. 
 
 President? President. Early 1800's. This must be The United States. I'm an American President. Well this is n't good. No, I ca n't give these speeches today, it could alter too much. 
 
 `` Cancel everything for today. I've decided to spend some time with my family.'' I say. Do I have a family? I think the American President's had families. Maybe I have a wife? 
 
 `` Are there any plays in the area?'' I say. `` Book a seating somewhere for me and my family.'' I grab the ridiculously tall hat sitting on the table in front of me. 
 
 `` As you wish President Lincoln.'' The man says, withdrawing from the room. 
 
 The world is probably better off with a few less speeches from an American President. It's not like one day of relaxing is n't American anyway. I've seen it all over the international news sites: American's are all about relaxing. Oh, I ca n't wait to get back to regular tea time.

 Until last week.

I always considered myself as a fast runner, but the humans make you feel like you can never run faster than a slow shuffle. They're supernatural. 
 
 There's one thing they do n't have, though - endurance. The poor bastards are exhausted after a measly few hours of running. For fear of a second attack, we all grouped together and stormed their camp. Of course they shot several of us and fled long before we could catch them, but they were on foot.

The strip joint had recently acquired the services of Mia Khalifa. The two black men were taken by her large breasts and beauty. Lenny then accosted Mia: `` Yo towl-hed you like da bbc?''. Taken aback by Lenny's charm and grace, Mia smiled and ran her finger down from her lips to her breasts. Lenny and James had their way with Mia. 
 
 The next day the two black lads made their way to Syria. They had only one thing on thier minds ( literally ): Mid-eastern females. 
 
 `` Ooga wa wa'' said James to the nearest Syrian female. She was taken by his charm and intellect, and the two immediately made their way to a public bathroom. James and Lenny were not fond of Syria. They did n't understand what the Arabic symbols meant, this however did not prevent the two gentlemen from staying in Syria for many years: they cucked many a Syrian male, and fucked many a Syrian female. 
 
 Nine months later, and 86 % of all newborns in Syria were black/arabic mixes. The Syrian men had taken a liking to having their women being stolen by blacks and had as a result opened the borders to black Ugandan men. 
 With the borders open, Syria and the mid-east in general degraded to nothing more and nothing less than deepest Africa.

 `` You will choose in a few moments if you want to die,'' he said, his long hair blowing in a nonexistent wind, `` or if you want me to heal you and return you to your life.'' 
 
 `` I want to go back!'' I yelled. `` I want to see my grandchildren grow up -- June and Michael.'' 
 
 `` Quiet!'' he said, clutching his ears. `` I am required to first show you the future.'' 
 
 *Okay, but I've already made my decision. * 
 
 `` You may change your mind.'' 
 
 The room turned dark, and a blurry, jittering picture was projected on the walls. I saw my house -- a stout, rotting little thing -- on its mound of land. A car pulled up, and my daughter climbed out with June and Michael. June's unruly hair was cut at the shoulder, and Michael grew half a foot. 
 
 *I'll see them again soon, * I thought, smiling. I glanced over to the odd man; he was stone-faced. 
 
 The children went inside, and the camera followed. I saw myself, setting a plate of sugar cookies on the kitchen table. They hugged me, and I hugged them back, grinning broadly. 
 
 The video -- or projection, hallucination, preview -- sped up. Grins flashed by the screen, cookie crumbs went flying. And then, just as the video became too fast to follow, it started at the beginning again. 
 
 Now June and Michael entered the house, but as preteens. Each had grown several inches and lost several pounds. They carried bookbags weighed down with homework, and their faces were spattered with acne. They entered the house. 
 
 No cookies this time. I instead sat at the table, arms crossed over my chest, stiff and pale. I gave out lukewarm hugs, and only smiled halfway. Conversation flashed by, but the grins were not nearly as bright. The visit was much shorter. 
 
 And the movie started again. June and Michael strode up to the house, fully grown teenagers -- or possibly even college students. Michael wore horn-rimmed glasses like his father, and carried a thin messenger bag. June had long hair, sleek boots, and her mother's bright eyes. 
 
 They hesitated in front of the house. `` How long do we have to stay?'' June whined. 
 
 `` A while. We have n't seen her in six months.'' 
 
 `` But she's so cranky,'' she replied. 
 
 I watched indignantly -- but as they entered the house, I froze. My other self was curled up on a chair, and barely looked up when they entered. `` Grandma,'' Michael said, wrapping me in a hug. I did n't hug back -- and did I glare at him? 
 
 `` How are you, since you left the university?'' I snapped at him. `` Lots of free time, I assume.'' 
 
 `` Grandma, be nice,'' June said quietly. `` We wanted to spend some time with you. Look, we brought you sugar cookies -- your favorite.'' 
 
 `` You know I have diabetes,'' I groaned. `` But sure, you guys go ahead and enjoy them.'' 
 
 `` Turn it off,'' I yelled at the weird man. `` Turn it off!'' June and Michael flickered, and the walls brightened to white. He looked at me, expectantly, hands over his ears. 
 
 `` What happened?'' I asked. `` How did I get so... mean?'' 
 
 `` When people exceed their date of death, they see younger and younger people getting the things in life they always wanted,'' he said. `` They fill with regret. They bloat with jealousy. They become bitter, mean, moping shells of themselves -- until they reject even the things they love the most.'' He put a hand on my shoulder. `` In other words, you die now, or you live long enough to become the villain.'' 
 
 I took a deep breath. *The world in which June and Michael hate me is no world I want to live in. It's not worth it. I love them, but... it's better this way. * 
 
 `` I see you've made your decision,'' he said. 
 
 The room faded to black.

8784,"[ WP ] A tiny man sits all alone at lunch in the prison yard . The old timers know to leave him alone . A new batch of prisoners arrive .
","Frank squinted as he stepped into the searing Nevada summer sun that beat down on the yard. His meat stood behind him, arms crossed, awaiting orders. Frank was new at High Desert, but his reputation preceded him. He spent his first week receiving tributes from the heads of the major prison gangs. 
 
 Those who had n't visited him initially had been corrected in the most definitive way -- everyone swore fealty, eventually. Except That Guy. 
 
 That Guy was a morsel of a man, almost child-like in stature, with skin so dark it seemed to absorb light, and a shock of white hair that would have made Doc Brown proud. As far as anyone could tell, he was a complete loner with no apparent allies or enemies. No one spoke to him, and he spoke to no one. He did n't participate in the gang politics, the bartering, and especially not the riots. 
 
 Frank's informants, who had been at the prison for years, told him all they knew about That Guy, but they could n't articulate why he was left alone. You just left That Guy alone, they insisted. 
 
 Naturally, Frank found their bumbling advice to be of no use to him, and sent his meat to retrieve That Guy, doing their best not to harm the little man if he resisted -- Frank was not an unnecessarily cruel man. They hesitantly set out across the yard to That Guy's corner, where he sat in the dust in the shade of the perimeter wall, reading a book. Frank watched them and waited. As they neared That Guy, they stopped. 
 
 That Guy did n't look up from his book, and did n't even appear to acknowledge the presence of Frank's meat. After a few moments, they turned and walked back to an incredulous Frank, returning to their positions at Frank's flanks without a word. 
 
 `` What the hell was that, gentlemen?'' Frank demanded of them. 
 
 `` He wo n't come to you,'' answered the braver of the two without meeting Frank's eye. 
 
 `` I did n't intend for you to give him an option. Was I not clear about that?'' 
 
 `` Wo n't come,'' restated the brave meat. 
 
 `` Are your arms broken? Your legs?'' Frank was losing his patience. 
 
 `` Nossir.'' 
 
 `` Would you like them broken?'' 
 
 `` Nossir.'' 
 
 `` Then get back out there and get That Guy,'' Frank insisted through clenched teeth. 
 
 Frank started to shake. These were the two biggest guys in the prison. It would take twice as many to replace them, and three times as many to enthusiastically remove them from their posts. He did n't like disobedience, but he would deal with that later. For now, he wanted to speak to That Guy. 
 
 `` I see,'' said Frank, with forced calm, `` I'll deal with you impertinent simpletons later.'' 
 
 He turned to look back out at That Guy. `` For the moment, I suppose *I'll* have to go to *him*,'' he said with nasally scorn. 
 
 Frank strode over to That Guy with purpose. He wanted to get this over with and get back to the shade of the pavilion. As he approached That Guy, he decided to stop short, though he was n't certain why -- apprehensiveness, perhaps, concerning the behavior of his meat. He addressed That Guy curtly. 
 
 `` My men tell me you will not move from your repose. I would have hoped that, like your fellow guests at High Desert, you would have sought an audience with me to swear your gifts or talents to my use.'' 
 
 That Guy did n't look up, nor did he speak. Frank did not appreciate being ignored any more than he appreciated disobedient meat. He sidled around That Guy to face him, but got no closer. That Guy's face was turned down deeply into his book, so Frank still did not catch his eye. 
 
 `` Are you deaf?'' Frank asked, realizing the futility of asking the question if the answer were true. He still received absolutely no reaction whatsoever from That Guy, and became increasingly incensed. Emboldened, he sat down in the dust directly in front of the man and waved his hand between the man's face and his book. 
 
 Still, That Guy offered no reaction. 
 
 Frank's patience broke, and he reared back his right hand to slap some sense into That Guy. 
 
 ``... them do to you.'' mumbled That Guy softly without moving or looking up. 
 
 Frank hesitated. `` Pardon me? You've finally decided to acknowledge my presence? Shall we drop this charade, then?'' 
 
 `` Do unto others...'' mumbled That Guy, still not looking up. 
 
 Without further thought, Frank resumed the almighty slap he had prepared earlier, connecting with the man's cheek with a satisfying smack. Almost immediately, Frank felt a searing pain in his left cheek, causing him to yell in surprise. 
 
 ``... the whole world blind.'' mumbled That Guy, who did not appear to have felt the slap. 
 
 Frank yelled with rage, dropping all semblance of gentlemanly decorum. He reached out and wrapped both hands around That Guy's neck. As he tightened his grip, he found it increasingly hard to get a full breath. Determined, he squeezed tighter and tighter. That Guy continued to look down at his book. 
 
 `` Look me in the eye, jackass!'' choked Frank, shaking the unresisting That Guy back and forth as he continued to squeeze tighter. That Guy finally raised his head, revealing empty eye sockets and a broad grin full of perfect teeth. 
 
 `` Eye for an eye...'' said That Guy, clearer than before. He was apparently completely unaffected by Frank's strangulation, while Frank's vision started to darken as he fought for air. 
 
 A gurgling cry was all Frank could manage before releasing his grip on That Guy and passing out. 
 
 That Guy returned to face his book, still grinning.

 God sat for a moment in thought, 
 
 `` It's probably too late to smite them, is n't it?'' the creator asked. 
 
 The angel looked down, 
 
 `` Yes. Even if you annihalated their world, chances are some would somehow escape unscathed.''

245762,"[ WP ] You begin a job interview , and gradually realize that the glass of water they 've given you is laced with truth serum ...
","James' sweat fell off his brow, offering its taste to his dry lips. He licked, wishing the salt was something sweeter. James' thirst throbbed in his throat, begging him to drowned its sorrow. He would have been delighted to do just this, but the water seated in front of him had not been offered. In fact, nobody was there to offer him anything, let alone the job he had been invited to discuss. This was all a part of the process, James assured himself. 
 
 The job in question was the first application James had sent in since he'd finished his sentence in prison. Through an unfortunate turn of events -or so his lawyer told him to say- he had found himself with the blood of a young woman on his hands. The tinge of warm fluid from his brow had reminded him of the taste, and James slipped into a thoughtless nostalgia. Victory had never been sweeter then when he walked away with only three years in the brink. 
 
 Just as he was recalling the woman's name, a stout, fat man came into the room. He was relaxed in his movements, making the whole ordeal seem unnatural. The weight seemed to wish for resistance, but the man slipped through the room with a revolting elegance. James sucked his teeth and sat forward, eager to leave the unholy sight. 
 
 `` You must be James Camsworth?'' 
 
 `` Uh- Yuh, that's me.'' 
 
 `` Right.'' 
 
 The man tittered, breaking his composure. For the first time, James was satisfied to see the stranger feel the resistance of his shape. Wriggling into his chair, he began to sweat a similar shade to James. 
 
 `` My name is Jonathon, and you must be unemployed?'' 
 
 `` Uh- Yuh.'' 
 
 Jonathon chirped again, and pushed forward the forgotten glass of water. 
 
 `` Please, drink.'' 
 
 James burst forward, leaving his composure. He drank heavily, gulping down each mouthful as if it were his last. Only after finishing the glass did James detect a metal tinge of flavor. It puzzled James, but he relinquished this by remembering the blood again. 
 
 Just as Jonathon began introducing the formalities of the interview, the room began to tilt to the left. After settling in, it pushed back to the right. An uneasy fog came into his vision, and James slumped back into his chair. Jonathon giggled again. 
 
 `` Are you feeling unwell, Mr. Camsworth?'' 
 
 `` Yuh... Yes,'' he struggled out. 
 
 James was upset with his response, as he had wished to lie. It would n't bid him well to seem sick, so he tried to make an excuse to his condition. 
 
 `` I... I'm feeling dizzy.'' 
 
 Jonathon chuckled slowly, relishing each piece of his voice. 
 
 `` Did you rape her?'' 
 
 Panic stormed through James' mind. 
 
 `` No,'' his mouth betrayed, `` I did not rape her.'' 
 
 Relief found Jonathon's face. Reaching deep into his desk, he pulled out a bottle of rye. He pulled heavily on the drink, letting his chin grow wet from the dribble. 
 
 `` Did you make her suffer?'' 
 
 James fought with everything to hold back the response. He could see the girl lying there, fighting back as the knife pierced her arm. He could hear the wet scream that followed. 
 
 `` As much as I could. She died before I wanted her to.'' 
 
 At this, a thick tear fell from Jonathon's eye, offering its taste to his wet lips. He licked it away, and reached into his desk. 
 
 `` Why did you kill my daughter?'' 
 
 The barrel of the gun stared through James, unmoved by its target. The sweat fell freely now, but no matter how hard he fought, he could feel the words coming out. 
 
 `` Because she let me.'' 
 
 The hammer of the gun cocked, exposing its intent to James. He began to whimper, letting the tears add to his soaked skin. Jonathon, finding his humor again, giggled at the grief. 
 
 `` Do you want to die, Mr. Camsworth?'' 
 
 `` God, Nuh-no. Please...'' 
 
 Uncontrollable laughter erupted from Jonathon. He squeezed hard on the trigger. 
 
 `` For you, Delilah.'' 
 
 James winced, but the bullet did n't seem to notice. It tore through his mind, ripping away the memories of his atrocity. James fought to remember anything, but could only think of nothing. Falling off of the chair, he thought only of the black.

217790,"[ WP ] For the last few days people have been randomly showing up at your door with no memory of how or why they arrived .
","The soft hiss of the brewing Keurig evokes a sense of calm inside me. I pour a generous amount of cream into my coffee and stir in a spoonful of sugar. As I wait for my coffee to cool down, I close my eyes, take a few breaths and meditate. *This will be a good day. You are a wonderful wife, co-worker and friend. You're hardworking. This will be a peaceful and routine day. * Matthew is peacefully sleeping and I savor these 30 minutes of time alone to reflect and prepare for the day. As I take a sip of coffee, a loud knock at the door forces me to inhale. Coughing and sputtering, I pad across the living room floor and gingerly press my face to the door to look through the peephole. *Spring has sprung, my ass. * This door feels like a sheet of ice against my cheek. 
 
 On the front stoop stands a man, somewhere in the mid- to upper-40s, balding, wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and a maroon sweat jacket. I place my hand on the knob and pause, ten different scenes of kidnap and murder running through my mind. Shaking my head, I open the door just enough for him to see my face. 
 
 `` Can I help you?'' I ask. 
 
 `` Um... who are you?'' He looks confused. 
 
 `` What? Who am I? Who are you? You showed up on my doorstep and knocked. Do you need help with something? Maybe a phone to call for a ride.'' I look down and am startled to observe his lack of shoes. *This guy is obviously still drunk from last night. Or some kind of drug addict, coming off of a bender. * 
 
 `` I-I do n't think so. I do n't know how I ended up here.'' He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a phone. He stares down at it for a few seconds, scrolling with his eyes. `` Nevermind, I'm sorry to have bothered you. I do n't know what happened last night, but maybe I got blackout drunk, or something. Ha, ha. Although it's weird, because I never drink. And I remember going to bed with my wife around ten p.m. Hmm.'' He scratches his head and looks around. 
 
 I stare at him. 
 
 `` I'm going to call my wife and see if she can pick me up. Where am I exactly?'' He asks. 
 
 `` 382 Iroquois Drive. Weston.'' 
 
 `` See that's even weirder! I live all the way across town on East Broad.'' 
 
 I'm just as confused as he is, but I just smile and shrug. `` I wish I could help you.'' 
 
 `` It's no problem. Again, I'm sorry to have bothered you.'' 
 
 I close the door and turn the lock as quietly as possible. *God, Matthew, please wake up. I'd feel much safer with you down here, in case this guy turns out to be some maniac serial killer. * 
 
 Pulling back the sheer curtain, I peer out the window and see the man standing right by the street in the grass, talking on his cell phone to someone, waving his hands animatedly. I just hope he gets the help he needs and finds his way home safely. Just as I'm about to walk away from the window, a dark blue sedan screeches up to the curb. The rear passenger side door opens and two hands emerge from the dark abyss of the interior of the car and grab the man around the waist and pulls him into the backseat, slamming the door shut in one fell swoop. The sedan speeds away, leaving burnt rubber tire marks in its wake. 
 
 `` OH MY GOD! What the hell?!'' I stare out the window, trying to wrap my mind around what just happened. Racing to the kitchen, I rip my charger out of my phone and dial 911. 
 
 `` Hi, um, this is Sarah Williams at 382 Iroquois Drive. I think I just witnessed an abduction!'' 
 
 Seven minutes later, I'm sitting on the couch, rubbing my hands back and forth on the upholstery when I hear another knock at the door. *Finally, the cops are here. * I open the door without hesitation to a young, dark haired woman in her mid-20s, wearing a navy pantsuit and carrying a briefcase. 
 
 `` Good morning, I'm Detective Thomas. I understand you reported a possible kidnapping or abduction here recently.'' 
 
 *Something is odd. Where is her police cruiser? Does n't she have a badge or some form of identification? * 
 
 `` Pardon me, Detective. It could be because I'm a little shaken up from what I just witnessed, but could you possibly show me your police ID badge? I just had a strange encounter with a man I did n't know who just showed up at my door without an idea how he got here and then got pulled into this car by someone who I could n't see and they just sped away and now I do n't know what to think or if I'm in any danger.'' Before I know it there are tears streaming down my face. 
 
 `` Not to worry ma'am, I'm here to help.'' Detective Thomas steps inside the house and delicately puts a hand on my shoulder. Reaching into her pocket, her grip on my shoulder becomes vise-like. She pulls out a long, metal device with a needle-like tip and shoves it into my neck. `` Shh,'' she coos, `` this will all be over soon.'' 
 
 I open my eyes and I'm standing in the kitchen, coffee steaming in front of me. I take a sip and meditate. *This will be a good day. You are a wonderful wife, co-worker and friend. You're hardworking. This will be a peaceful and routine day. *

67723,"[ WP ] Write me a story where the main character can hear the narrator
","Casey sat at a desk, writing utensil in hand, scribbling furiously on a piece of paper. Whenever he couldn ’ t come up with the next word to write, he would tap vigorously with his pencil until inspiration arrived. He enjoyed writing and spent most of his free time just plugging away, graphite on the sheet. Today was one of those days. 
 
 
 In Casey ’ s story, Nolan was slogging halfheartedly through a knee deep swamp that bordered Kahrin. A smell that brought to mind rancid tomatoes floated into Nolan ’ s nostrils. He grimaced and bared with the situation he had been put in. A tapping noise flooded his ears from above him. He gritted his teeth and looked angrily up into the green stained sky. 
 
 
 “ Dude, your attitude is making it really hard to work on this! ” exclaimed Casey. 
 
 
 “ Where are we headed, it feels like we ’ ve been walking forever! ” complained Nolan. 
 
 
 “ I ’ m not sure yet, let ’ s just keep going. ” 
 
 
 “ You ’ re not sure? You ’ ve been writing this for ages, and you ’ re still not sure where we ’ re going to end up? ” 
 
 
 “ Why do you say we? You ’ re the one in the story. ” Pointed out Casey, slightly disgruntled. 
 
 
 “ Oh, you ’ re right, screw you. ” Nolan growled. 
 
 
 Casey sighed. “ Where do YOU want to end up? ” 
 
 
 “ That isn ’ t my job you ditz. You put me here, figure it out yourself. ” 
 
 
 “ No, no, no, you ’ re supposed to strive for the courage to take control of your fate! ” 
 
 
 “ I can ’ t help it if you can ’ t write a character with courage to save your own hide. ” 
 
 
 “ How about you grow a little backbone then. ” spit Casey, exasperated. 
 
 
 “ Right, yea, why don ’ t I grow a little backbone, why don ’ t you give me a little if you really care that much. ” 
 
 
 “ My point is that you ’ re the one making your own decisions... ” mumbled the writer dejectedly. It was too quiet for his character to hear. 
 
 
 “ Couldn ’ t you have at least written in a romantic subplot? I ’ m so bored..., ” lamented Nolan. He unlodged his feet from the sticky mud and continued trudging. 
 
 
 “ Then why didn ’ t you make one yourself? ” Yelled a disconcerted Casey. 
 
 
 “ I CAN ’ T! I ’ m not the one who's calling the shots here! ” 
 
 
 “ You live through a testament of your own willpower! You ’ re a hero, striving out against a sea of enemies! ” 
 
 
 Nolan shook his head and continued walking. “ You ’ re terribly misled. Have you finished the plot yet? ” 
 
 
 “ No, good ending will come with time. ” 
 
 
 “ Can you just have me collapse in the swamp or something? ” 
 
 
 “ Christ man! What happened to you? ” 
 
 
 “ Sorry I can ’ t just accept what some blubbering idiot writes up for me. Like, do you really think that getting bullied into going on a journey is enough to build the strength to go save a princess or whatever I ’ m trying to do? I don ’ t even know any more. ” 
 
 
 “ You ’ re the one creating your own fate though... ” 
 
 
 
 “ No, you are, I ’ m just following what you write, ” said Nolan, tone low and aggressive, eyes back in the mud. 
 
 
 A melancholy look passed over the writer ’ s lips and he began to rummage around in his desk. Nolan stood angrily, waiting for the writer ’ s next words, but they never came. Casey ripped up his first page. “ Wait, what are you doing? No! Stop! ” Nolan blurted, surprised. Casey ripped another, saying nothing. 
 
 
 “ Stop man, you ’ re destroying your own work! ” Another rip. 
 
 
 “ That ’ s my past! Casey, please, what are you doing? ” But Casey wouldn ’ t stop, headless of Nolan ’ s cries. 
 
 
 In just a few minutes, all fifty pages of his story lay in pieces on Casey ’ s desk, save but one, still in his hands. 
 
 
 “ You ’ re right! You were right! Please! ” Nolan cried, panicked and frantic, “ I ’ m in control of my own fate, you don ’ t have to do this! ” 
 
 
 The angered writer centered his eyes directly on the last words of his story. His stare was cold as ice, composed and heartless. “ Then prove it. ” 
 
 
 The last page fluttered to the surface of Casey ’ s desk and came to a rest, cleanly in two.

122848,"[ WP ] In the 23rd century , the United States elects its first Amish president .
","Twenty four years ago, the most powerful nations on earth triggered a free-for-all conventional war after years of peace. Humanity experienced a technological Renaissance in the early 21st century and we were hungry for more after centuries of stagnation. Our politicians were all vying for a new resource at the bottom of the sea that could trigger another technological advance and each of our nations wanted it for itself. After conventional war resulted in an increasingly desperate stalemate, a series of events triggered escalation to using nuclear weapons. Automatic protocols went into effect and before anyone could react, a full blown nuclear war was underway. 
 
 The world as we knew it was completely leveled, with the primary aggressors completely demolished. Additionally, the industrial network ( IN ), formerly known as the'developed nations', all held alliances with the superpowers ( United States, New Russia, and the Trans-pacific Chinese Empire ). The IN were the secondary targets of the nuclear attacks. Without industrial backing, the superpowers expected their enemies would crumble after the fallout. At the end of it all, the world's population shriveled into nothingness and humanity's technology rendered obsolete with the EMP blasts. Humanities various colonies on Mars and Luna were not spared either. In the span of hours, we had settled our fate. 
 
 With less than one percent of the population remaining, the survivors were completely unprepared: we had no reserve for crops or agricultural knowledge, we were spoiled by a diet of advanced processed food, and most importantly, we did n't know how to live without technology. Robots provided us our water, food, and built our shelter. 
 
 Furthermore, the majority of our leadership were killed in the nuclear attack. We would n't have listened to their orders anyway, as we resented that our world ceased to exist because of their short-sighted greed. The only reason the `` United States'' existed was a centuries-old radio network that survived the war. From the silence on the radio, we knew there was no one else, except a number of seemingly unharmed communities across America. 
 
 We were hungry, tired, and without hope. One man, Issac Samuels, saved us all. Samuels' was largely unaffected by the war and subsequent nuclear detonations. His Pennsylvania farm, tucked away in the rural mountains, was largely unaffected by technological proliferation and the war. A few months after the war, he noticed bands of survivors coming over his property for food and aid. Society may have ridiculed the man for his then-archiac beliefs and preferred his isolated state, but he responded with kindness. 
 
 He provided shelter for the weak, and taught them how to work the land, and how to prepare good Amish food. He taught us what it meant to be human and not technology-bound slaves. Word spread, and his survivors would record his lessons and broadcast them on the old radio network. To help his neighbors, he established a bureaucracy of assistants who helped oversee others' farms and distribute his knowledge. Samuels, who abhorred the use of technology, allowed transmission of his lessons by radio until he found another way to save human life. 
 
 One of Samuels' assistants discovered a way to find pockets and passages in the thick haze of irradiation that lay between our settlements. Since that time, our settlements have grown and we have left our relic of a radio system behind. With a continuous stream of traders and messages being transmitted between settlements, our bond and unification as a nation was restored. 
 
 With Samuels' enlightenment, we have cast aside our old bonds. It started in Arizona, but a nickname for Samuels began to spread through the settlements. One that demonstrated reverence and acknowledgment of his leadership in our time of need: President.

","The Avatar dreamed of swimming serenely in the Sea of Tranquility. It fluttered it's fins and the moon dust rose lazily and settled softly. It was on the hunt for its next meal, perhaps a humble moon seal or a patch of floating red roses. 
 
 Of course none of that was real, the Avatar was actually many minds hacked together with the computational equivalent of duct tape and liberal amounts of hope. It's mind actually ran across many machines and the food it searched for was additional computational power, usually obtained by expanding its botnet. 
 
 It thought it could photosynthesis too. In reality this was when another user voluntarily signed up for the Folding @ Home analogue I helped design; users would lend unused cycles for the avatar to use as extra brain power. 
 
 The Avatar was n't always an antediluvian leviathan hunting on the moon. Sometimes it was a mother preparing it's child for school, sometimes it was two lovers, sometimes it was a world war I era soldier peeking over the trenches. But thankfully most of its dreams were more pleasant than that last one. 
 
 I was part of the maintenance team for the Avatar. Me and six other people were responsible for the upkeep of the greatest experiment in neurology and computer science ever devised. Six. Triple A games had teams of hundreds now, Halo 8 is rumored to have a development team approaching 1000. 
 
 The Avatar seemed like a good idea at the time. Upload human minds, the first steps to immortality, the first steps to the great savior of a General AI. It was all very compelling I'm told. But the first problem identified almost killed the project, it turned out the upload process would essentially kill the uploadee. Which was preferable to the permanent vegetative state they would be in if it did n't kill them. 
 
 But the great doctor could n't turn his back on the process. No, he was far too proud. He actually managed to find volunteers willing to die for this. He would say things like `` Imagine your flesh is like a cocoon, the caterpillar dies but the butterfly is born.'' People fell for it. 
 
 The first few uploads retained individual identities, and had independent existences. If you could call them that. The big upload put a mind into a computer when it needed to be in the squishy meat world. People could n't think as well and drifted to a permanent sleep-like state we called `` Lotus Eating.'' At least they could live out their fantasies. But having all those people in one system caused them to... meld. We noticed after the tenth upload that their existences stopped being parallel, and the began to dream the same dreams. 
 
 Their collected minds were powerful, more powerful than we had the hardware for. As soon as we could we moved the project from our server farm onto the internet. It meant that the Avatar would now live and dream on past the eventual mothballing of the server farm required to run it, and it also meant it's services could be sold. 
 
 A parallel processor of the Avatar's size was actually pretty useful to Big Data. Surveillance and collection had grown to such a point that the sheer size of the databases made them essentially useless to search through, despite the improvements in search algorithms. But for the right price you could get the Avatar to perform the search for you. 
 
 I was part of the team that coded that capability in. It's actually pretty clever how we did it, but I wo n't waste your time. Suffice it to say that when we ran searches through the Avatar it dreamt some very messed up dreams. Being caught in Minos' Labyrinth with a hungry lovecraftian monster on your tail kind of messed up. Still it performed admirably. 
 
 And the uploads just kept coming! We celebrated the first thousand. We groaned at ten thousand. 
 
 The Avatar outgrew us. It did n't perform searches. We tried to monetize it, but it insisted on dreaming its dreams and ignoring what we needed it to do. So the project slowed, and dwindled. And now we're at me and six other guys running this thing, trying to get it to survive. And in the meantime it had devised a so far undetected bot net as a matter of survival, just so it could feed it's growing mind as a matter of survival 
 
 The great doctor eventually joined the Avatar too, when his money ran out. He called it appropriate and said he looked forward to joining the great mind. I knew he just wanted to commit suicide. 
 
 I got a call from some smooth toned agent asking us for access to the Avatar. I told him it's all available online, go ahead and see. He said that it was n't enough. He wanted the data. 
 
 We've heard it before. All those searches were retained in the Avatar. And more. It had access to a lot of the world's most precious resource: information. And it could get more very easily, with the right prodding. 
 
 I told him to stuff it, he could n't get anything like primary access to the Avatar. Not the least because nobody understood it anymore. He would just have to deal with not having that data for whatever blackbag operation he needed it for. 
 
 He told me to have a nice day and to be careful. It sounded menacing, but I was n't worried. I'd survived worse during my conscription. 
 
 The next day we were served. The government wanted to shut us down. They cited national security concerns. I groaned. 
 
 I tried to contact Subiyesk, our megacorp patron of the month, for a legal contract but was put on hold for hours upon hours. Usually they were quicker with their service, but I had a feeling that we were being hung out to dry over this. Or worse, Subiyesk and the other megacorps were colluding to finally get access to the Avatar. They'd probably break it down bit by bit and like a neurosurgeon hunting for memories with a scalpel all they'd do was make an absolute mess of it. 
 
 I was n't sure who to turn to. I cried at my desk. I looked at the screen again, this time the Avatar was a tree growing large in the warm light of the sun with skittering squirrels living happily in its branches. I looked at the upload crown sat on one of our hospital beds. I put it on *and felt the warmth in my leaves as I reached for the sun, never able to get there and even if I could I'd burn forever. *

123857,"[ EU ] Write a story set in the Harry Potter universe , where Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are the two main conflicting houses in Hogwarts instead of Gryffindor and Slytherin .
","For some people, the novelty of magic never wears off. I'm not one of those people, and neither are the students who I spend most of my time with at Hogwarts. In Ravenclaw, by the end of the first year, if your grades are good enough and you've got the social smarts, the world of magic takes a backseat, and the world of money makes an entrance. 
 
 I was scouted in my first semester. 
 
 Got pulled into the dorm room that the older students always hanged around, and forced to choose between swearing an oath of secrecy and loyalty to the house, or rejecting the offer and spending the rest of my school years stuck learning useless magic like Gryffindor or Slytherin. Of course, they already knew what my answer would be. When you've got older siblings on the team and the sorting hat gives you Ravenclaw, it's an easy pick. At that time, Ravenclaw's empire was at its peak. Our product was so good that our headmaster spent an entire year cold-shouldering his so-called Chosen One ( that's Harry Potter if you have n't been reading the news ) after a summer-long bender that gave the old man a depressive comedown immune to magical treatment. 
 
 When I was inaugurated, the team could n't have been happier to have another Ashmore boy on the team, given that Hufflepuff had been making more ground each day targeting the younger students. Ravenclaw sold good sh*t, but it was expensive, and although the idiots at Slytherin had more than enough of their parent's money to spend on our stuff, Hufflepuff's customer base was larger and we were losing more buyers to the weaker, but cheaper, Hufflepuff product. 
 
 As if that was n't bad enough for Ravenclaw, they had a Hufflepuff informant on the inside. Worse yet, that informant was me.

","Various people at the party had a bit too much to drink as the night went on and the handshakes continued. 
 
 `` Is n't this fun? Shaking everyone's hand? Mr. Bennett always thinks up the best games for his parties,'' remarked a woman clad in a silver sequin dress to her husband while sipping her fourth glass of champagne and locking hands with a short red headed woman. `` Miranda! Nice to meet you! Wait, I believe we have shook hands already this evening - I'm not sure.'' 
 
 This was a gathering of the elite, and although the rules expressly stated only one handshake per person, many eager businessmen were set on getting face time with the key policy makers in attendance, most notably a keen and gregarious gubernatorial hopeful, Grover Cleveland. Handshakes were made in greeting, in parting, and in between as verbal agreements were struck and points agreed upon. It was handshaking mayhem in every sense of the word.

","“ Samson! I need covers 2 and 3 for Table 32! And for Christ ’ s sake, quit sending out the medium rare T-bones as medium – they got ta *kiss* the pan, not fuck it! ” 
 
 Samson cursed silently and muttered under his breath. *As if that pimply, fat bastard knew the first thing about kissing or fucking*. He punctured several eggs and smashed them into a pan, scraping most of the shell out with several quick flicks. Spearing a T-bone from the container besides him, he flung it on an adjacent pan, cursing again as spots of oil shot up and slithered down his torso. 
 
 Despite the heavy sizzling and industrial fans, Samson could hear footsteps approaching from the dining area. The din of gabby, face-stuffing patrons acted only as a backdrop to the squishy, beefy gait that never failed to send a shivering nausea through his being. He saw the bloated, hairy gut poking out of the buttoned gaps of a shiny purple dress shirt first, followed by the red, blotchy tongue that seemed to slither its way out like a baby snake. The rest of Orrin Muppet appeared to almost drag itself behind, as if helplessly resigned to being dead, abused weight. 
 
 “ Samson, you fucking cuntstick! ” the man bellowed, his jowls shaking like Jello in flight. “ Tables 19 and 25 have been waiting for 20 minutes and…what in the flying hell fuck are you doing with that steak? Do I have to shove a chop up that pointy metal ass of yours before you learn the term ‘ medium rare? ” 
 
 “ With respect, sir, ” Samson breathed through gritted teeth, “ Wayne called in sick, and I ’ m the only line cook here today. Even your sous is out doing God knows downstairs, and… ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t give *two flying cockgobbers*, you lazy, ungrateful toe fungus! If I have to teach you how to do your job, I may as well cut off my balls and send them to that whore who shat your oblong ass out! Hell, maybe she can come down here and give it a whirl. It certainly couldn ’ t be any fucking worse now, could it? ” 
 
 Samson shook off a spatula from his extended limb, watching it clank on the tile floor with a blank gaze before eyeing Orrin at a dead stare. The man ’ s eyes grew wider, his grimace gradually being replaced with an open-mouthed gape. “ You don ’ t speak of my mother, ” Samson replied flatly. 
 
 “ Look now, kid, this is my restaurant, and I ’ ll run it as I see fit, you hear? ” His voice was quavering. “ Now, are you going to get back to work, or… ” 
 
 Samson shimmied forward, a glistening metal point aimed straight ahead. 
 
 “ Hey now! Hey! Look, enough. We ’ re done here, yeah? We ’ re fucking done. ” 
 
 Samson spat an inch away from the man ’ s shoes. “ Yeah, boss. We ’ re done. ”

 Creamy white folds enveloped his skin as he rolled along its gentle surface, their mutual caresses a symphony of tactile eroticism. Swirls of black arose from below, snaking upward with dizzying speed, sliding in and around his body. They branched out in every which way, forming new lines and symbols and meanings with each turn, their curves gently pressing both against and with their alabaster host. The beauty was consuming, gut-churning, impossible… 
 
 A sharp knock broke Samson ’ s reverie. He groaned, shaking the heaviness from his head. The stickiness in his mouth was oppressive, and he had the sensation of thick lead weights hanging from the rest of him. 
 
 Three more knocks. Louder and more urgent. Samson cursed loudly and heaved himself out of bed, rolling along the floor several times before propping himself up and sneering at the front door. “ Hold your fucking horses, ” he spat, trudging the narrow length of the room he rented above *Cheetah ’ s Jug and Cans*. 
 
 Forgoing the traditional keyhole vetting, Samson unlatched the deadbolt and lock and swung the door open, posturing a bored slouch and yawning. 
 
 “ Ah, what in the Nine Hells, ” he muttered. 
 
 “ Is that any way to greet an old friend? ” came the bubbly response, practically sing-songing the words. 
 
 “ I ’ m sure Dr. Frankenstein said the same thing, you waspy bastard, ” Samson replied. “ Ah, Christ. You may as well come in, ” he gestured with a bob of his head. 
 
 The man stepped deftly inside. He was a short, slender figure, sharply dressed in a black and white jacketed suit with slicked back red hair. His pant legs and sleeves were just slightly too short, and, along with his wide grin and cherubic features, gave him the appearance of a buoyant, well-to-do child who had just grown out of his First Communion outfit. 
 
 “ My, my! How far the mighty have fallen! ” he chirped, giving an exaggerated, gazing scan of the room. “ Or are we going for the ‘ eccentric millionaire ’ motif? ” 
 
 “ Pike off, Willy, ” Samson snarled. “ I did the best I could with what you bloodsuckers left me with. ” 
 
 “ Oh, Clippit, ” Willy replied, his tone more severe. “ This is what happens when you don ’ t follow proper protocol and… ” 
 
 “ No! ” Samson boomed, pivoting violently to face his guest. “ This is what happens when you delusional, narcissistic suits decide to play God with unnatural forces! ” 
 
 “ Clippy, Clippy, we gave you more than enough… ” 
 
 “ And stop calling me that! I ’ m Samson now. Samson B. Rutherford Hayes. ” 
 
 “ You can ’ t escape your past, Clippit. You can ’ t deny who you are. ” 
 
 He lunged at the man, swiping his metal curves like a caged wildebeest before losing balance and crashing to the carpet. 
 
 Willy walked over to him, staring for a moment before crouching down and offering his hand. “ It ’ s not you, Clippit. ” 
 
 Samson began to sob. “ At least it ’ s something I could choose, ” he yelled meekly. “ At least I had a choice. ” 
 
 Willy pulled him up, steadying his balance before taking a step back. “ I have a better choice for you. How would you like to come back? ” 
 
 “ What the hell do you mean, ‘ come back? ’ ” Samson replied shakily, glaring at him through narrowing eyes. 
 
 “ People have very short memories, Clippit. They ’ re quick to forget who they love, and even quicker to forget who they hate. And we have need of you. ” 
 
 Samson swayed side to side vigorously. “ They didn ’ t just hate me, Willy. *They despised me*. All I did was try to help – exactly what you programmed me to do! And they spat on me like I was less than trash. ” 
 
 The man nodded. “ I know, Clippit. But you ’ ll have to trust me when I say that is all but forgotten now. We have… ” 
 
 “ It ’ s not forgotten to *me*, Willy! I haven ’ t forgotten it! I wake up every night – sometimes 5, 6 times – drowning in cold sweat at what they did to me, the vile things they wrote and said! ” 
 
 “ Clippit, please! ” The man ’ s voice grew harsh, chastising. “ This is bigger than you or me. We are at *war*, son. ” 
 
 Samson cocked his head, still breathing heavily. 
 
 “ It ’ s Windows 11, Clippit. It ’ s gone rogue. ”

39372,"[ WP ] A person dies and is whisked to limbo ...
","He raised his gaze from the numerous papers and documents before him as three quick knocks landed upon his door. `` Come in'', he said. 
 
 The gatekeeper stepped into his office, closing the door behind him. `` We have a bit of a problem sir,'' she stated simply `` something I've never seen before.'' 
 
 This statement did not receive much of his attention, since there was nothing he had not seen before. `` Oh?'' he replied, his bushy grey eyebrows raised with skepticism. 
 
 `` Well, as you know, I tend to the third and final gate. Long ago, a strange soul passed through to this gate. He was an angry soul, a twisted sort of soul'', she lamented `` I was about to begin the reckoning, when he asked me to stop. He just turned and went back into limbo. Into the abyss'' 
 
 The gatekeeper continued, `` Then, many ages later, the same soul came through to the gate again. Again, he refused judgement, and attempted to attack the gate, screaming about having been turned away at every gate. How it was n't his fault.'' 
 
 Setting down his pen and shifting uncomfortably in his chair, the old man at the desk drew his full attention to the gatekeeper, a curious look now upon his face. 
 
 `` I sent word to the other gatekeepers, and they both confirmed my suspicions. He had been to each gate twice, had refused judgement, and somehow found his way through to the other gates.'' She hesitated, `` That was many, many ages ago, and I had almost forgotten about it.'' 
 
 `` An unusual story,'' the old man replied, `` but as you know, some souls require a great deal of time to come to terms with their judgement. He will pass through eventually.'' 
 
 `` I had thought so,'' she began, `` but then I decided to dig through some of the old records. It turns out he has been wandering far longer than any other soul I've ever seen. Ages upon ages of records have him finding his way through to the gates, only to refuse judgement and return to limbo. When he came through to me the third time, I asked him to wait at the gate. Will you see him?'' 
 
 `` Of course. ``, he stated simply, rising from his chair. 
 
 
 
 * * * 
 
 
 
 The angry soul passed along the outside of the gates pacing impatiently, back and fourth, wanting to run off into the endlessness of the abyss, to wander for another age or two before even thinking about returning again. Not wanting to face what he knew was to come. 
 
 `` Do you yet accept your judgement?'' the voice jolted him from his thoughts. He looked up to see the old man standing before him, looking down upon him. Judging him. 
 
 `` Never!'' he retorted sharply, `` An unjust fate I will not accept.'' He continued to pace back and forth, focused on his rage, not noticing the pained expression upon the face of the old man. 
 
 `` I gave my life for you! ``, he stopped and turned away, `` they condemned me! Now you condemn me with your judgement.'' 
 
 The old man wiped a tear from his eye, and waited a good while before he was able to speak. `` In judgement, there is forgiveness.'' he said softly, `` How long have you endured the endless abyss. How much longer will you wander?'' 
 
 He turned suddenly to face the old man directly, and looked him in the eye. `` I do n't want go back, please do n't condemn me.'' 
 
 The old man held his ground, and spoke slowly in a stern voice, `` You must, and you will. You know it is the only way for you to grow. You still have much left to learn, and much left to teach.'' 
 
 `` How many times? How many times must I go back? How many times must they be shown the way? ``, looking down, he turned away again. 
 
 The old man placed his hand upon the troubled soul `` Until every soul is saved. Until greed and suffering no longer exist. Until the tools of war are laid to rest and forgotten. I will give you the strength to endure. I will be there to bear the burden with you, and I will not forsake you.'' 
 
 He turned one more time to face the old man squarely, brushing away his hand, and looked him in the eye. `` I can not save them.'' He turned abruptly, and walked off into the unknown. Back into the abyss.

 The gatekeeper had witnessed the exchange from a distance, and could n't help but wonder about the strange incident. In her lengthy term as a gatekeeper, she had never seen such a thing. Soon enough, her curiosity had gotten the best of her, and before she knew it, she found herself walking up to the office to inquire. She found the reception area strangely empty and quiet, and the office door was ajar. She thought she heard a noise coming from inside the office, and stepped in quickly to see what was going on. 
 
 The old man sat at his desk, quietly weeping. He sat up abruptly when the gatekeeper entered. `` Are you ok?'' she asked, quite shocked at the sight, `` Who was that?''. God leaned back in his chair, pausing to compose himself enough to speak. `` My son. That was my son.''

","I've never left home. 
 
 When I was a boy, I used to think my whole world was everything around me. Things were always within a drive's reach to get to. My parents lived in the country, occasionally you can hear a semi drive by our approach but we rarely got any unwanted visitors. We could drive into town for medicine, food, or necessities. 
 
 When I got into high school, a lot of my world had already grown but now my friends were talking about leaving the state. To me, my world was always going to be working at here at my parent's ranch and during the winter at the casino for a little extra cash, for me I thought this was the rest of my life. 
 
 I was working in the surveillance when I seen the foreigners come into our casino's hotel. These men and women with their hair neatly fixed and bowing at people after they've finished a conversation. When one of them came out of their room for a fire alarm, they wore a robe called'kimono', and from there I wanted to know more about their culture. 
 
 My culture was: my mother was Native American, and my father was Irish-German Polish. Although, both only knew so much about their own history, my paternal grandparents celebrated different holidays with amazing foods, but so did my maternal side. On my mother's side, they had a lot of difficult and devoted ceremonies that I was too lazy to attend. Although, when I seen the Japanese culture, I found myself going to the library for the first time in my life outside of school, and about six months and a few online courses later, I booked a ticket for Tokyo. 
 
 My flight was going to be in two months, so I finished up my recommended vaccinations, finalized my passport, opened a japan exchange bank account, and continued to learn writing and speaking as much as possible. I felt like this is where my life was suppose to go, the nervousness and excitement I felt every night set in as looked at my watch's countdown clock for the trip. I was using up a significant portion of my savings that was suppose to be for college, but never could commit to. My parent's questioned me and my mother did n't want me to leave for three weeks, but I just had to even though I never left the state before other than to an auction in North Dakota or Montana, the only place I've ever been around is South Dakota. 
 
 The flight was long, there was a little boy who kept looking at me through the seats and bothered me. After about an hour in though, we found a medium: he played a gameboy, too. When he showed me his, everything was in katakana, japanese writing. After I went to the bathroom, he found out about my Pokemon and Legend of Zelda Games, and he also commented on my height. Before we went to sleep, he gave me his friend code. His name is Huey, short for Hitaro Uehara. 
 
 When I got into the Narita airport, through passport control, and down into the terminal restaurant lobby, everything was so amazing to me. I felt like I could n't stop smiling. I looked like a midwestern US tourist, a checkered patterned open up button shirt with a white shirt underneath, blue jeans, lace boots, the oddest parts about me were my iWatch and I was about a good 8 inches to a foot taller than everyone. I was slightly brown because of my mother's genes from this past summer and my dark brown hair helped. As I walked through the airport, I was already getting looks even from the white people there, which was normal when I was n't on the reservation and in the city after summer. I got a few rice rolls, and I have to say they were way better from when I tried cooking them, they even had the nori part that you could hold them with. I hung out longer than I should have at the airport. 
 
 When I finally got out, I got on a train below the airport, we had a few stops until we started going to Tokyo, and I savored every moment I was going into the city. When I got off, I wandered a bit more and my alarm went off to signal my room was ready at the hotel I chose. My parent's last minute decided to help me with my trip and gave me some money to cover the expenses, only because they want me to go to college some day.. Although, after everything that happened I do n't think its possible. 
 
 I wandered for the first few days around Tokyo, met other tourists, and tried a lot of foods. Although, the new feeling wore off a little when some people would n't serve me, others would n't talk, or worse some girls followed me. So, one night I decided I was going to drink with someone I could find. I found a businessman who was already a few sakis deep. I drank, visited as much as we could, and we played cards, he was a gambler, we even wandered around a little. 
 
 When the night was ending, he told me `` You should travel out of Tokyo, yes? Much more'TRUE' Japanese culture can be found when you wander the country a little. Visit my family in Kyoto... Here, I call now!'' After a moment of him fumbling his phone, he held down his screen and dialed, while it rang he signaled for another bar near by. As we walked in, he pointed over to a booth for me to sit. He walked up to the bar and ordered drinks with the phone next to his ear. As he walked back up with the hostess carrying a couple of saki bottles, he was into an intense conversation. When it ended he threw his phone on the table and grabbed the cup I poured his saki into. `` My brother says,'yes, come'. So tonight, we shall drink to the people of the world! KAMPAI!'' His cup bounced into mine. He gave me the cheapest way to get to Kyoto and told me to try a ramen shop by the station before I left. He also gave me his number, so he can see me again before I left. 
 
 As I got back on the railway, I had some really good ramen, the man was not wrong. As I traveled the country side looked like the prairie back home at some parts, but this at this time our fields would be turning golden instead of a continued lush green. I thought about a lot of things, and perhaps, I should go to school because if I am missing out on places like this, what else could I have yet to discover? 
 
 When I got into Kyoto Station, I followed the man's directions to another shop, and back on to his family's home. When I arrived, it was a large gate to greet me, which was very intimidating. I used one of the knockers and a elderly man greeted me, `` Bo-Bee-san?'' he muttered out. 
 
 `` Hai'', I said and bowed. 
 
 Today was going to be the start, the beginning of my new life. If I knew this, I would n't have come for another couple of days. 
 
 As I walked closer and closer into the family home, the hairs on my neck began to stand up. I started to feel more vibrant and colors became deeper and brighter, I started to hear more, with each step I started to feel stronger and healthier, mostly because that stomach and head ache from drinking was fading fast. I walked into the room he placed my duffle in, and he opened his hand for me to enter, there was also a bed near by already rolled out for me. 
 
 I'll translate this next part, `` The master will be home soon, Yosuke-senpai.'' 
 
 I bowed as he exited, and looked around. I could feel this new energy as I sat into the room, at first, I thought it was the energy or incense they burned here. It would n't be until dinner i'd find out what was happening. 
 
 After I met Yosuke, who was happy to accommodate me so quickly, he had questions, mostly about his brother and his rash decisions. Although, he did enjoy the new company. He was a fisherman and home for the week, he family was large and they would host a lot of people in their home, many of the stories he started talking to me about were overwhelming to begin with and I was happy he could speak english. When we finished, he sat everyone down for dinner, his wife, their three sons, and two daughters. 
 
 When I met Nao, she was trying to be cool. Her grip shattered a glass at the table. I noticed he was having trouble with her hearing as well, and thats when I decided to try whispering something to her. 
 
 `` I'm having the same problem, too.'' 
 
 She looked directly at me, wide eyed, and stood up. Everyone at the table was startled by her quickness, so she tried to cover it up by using the toilet. I was curious so I asked where I could also use the bath room, and followed her. 
 
 `` Stop,'' I said and she waited for me. 
 
 As we got closer, I could feel my body becoming more intense, Her hair started turning lighter, and my spine popped a few times with each step. When I was directly behind her, I felt like I could crush a car. She bolted, and with her first step it dug into the wood as she pushed off, she disappeared in a blur. I ran outside and she stood in the entry panting, I looked around and seen a rock next to the door, so I picked it up and crushed it with ease. I looked at her and she giggled, so I smiled back and chuckled. 
 
 She walked up to me and kissed me then and there.

122600,"[ WP ] Create a new creation myth .
","One by one five beings emerged from the darkness. 
 
 The first, wanted excitement, a reprieve from the abyss. 
 He created something active, something revealing. 
 But it spread. 
 He needed something to stop it. 
 So he created something unyielding, something solid. 
 But it could not hold the fire down. 
 He sought to calm the flame, to quench its hunger. 
 So He created something soothing, something pervasive. 
 But after stopping the fire, it stagnated. 
 And so he desired movement, a constant activity. 
 Finally he created something swift, something untamable. 
 And he was gone. 
 
 The Second, never having seen the abyss deemed this world desolate. 
 So she combined wind and fire to create the sky and a source of energy. 
 But she was not pleased with its repetitiveness. 
 So she combined earth and water to create simple life, that could thrive anywhere. 
 But she was not pleased with how slow it was. 
 So she combined wind and earth to create active life, that must fight to survive. 
 But she was not pleased with its lack of imagination. 
 So she combined fire and earth to create ambitious life, that would always strive for more. 
 And then she was gone. 
 
 The third, saw the earth, wind, fire, water and life, and decided there should be more. 
 He created a place beyond what was reachable. 
 Beyond the simple rules that governed this world. 
 He created a place to strive for and a way for this place to reach into the world below. 
 And he rested in his plane. 
 
 The fourth, saw all that had been done and desired a plane of her own. 
 Below the world she staked her claim and set out to create. 
 But any land she created came out ugly and any life malformed and viscous. 
 Seeing the beautiful creations of her siblings she grew jealous. 
 So she schemed and instilled an end in all that was above. 
 And when something falls it falls to her. 
 
 The fifth, seeing all that was made wished only to experience it before it came to an end. 
 And it is said that he still journeys across the world even to this day.

197589,"[ WP ] Your quest is over , for you now stand before the Door of Dreams .
","It was a rather simple door, it's color was a dull fading white Ashwood with trim the color of caramel melting under heat. It was absolutely ordinary. Everything around it? That was a different story. It was a college by all purpose except it was quiet. No chatter of classes no lecture droning on. It was so quiet you could hear the whisper of a ghost hair falling to caress the ground. The withered husks and slime that we're once men littered the ground behind me leaving puddles of ooze hissing on the white tile like acid. I suppose I should tell you how I came to be here, though it's a simple tale it begins thus... 
 
 Its been 120 years since my family discovered the book that led us on our quest to find the Door of Dreams. My father was a hunter like his father and his father before him. What we hunted were things out of nightmares. 
 
 We hunted the beasts of Yharnam, the Great One Ebriatas, the Vileblood clans of Cainhurst, and the witches of Hemwick. 
 We fought our way through the murky depths of The Forbidden Forest, and the bowels of the chalice fighting all manner of evil. 
 
 The Great Ones whisper of a secret to the ears of the School of Mensis. The ones who whisper back. The ones who worship and study the gods, or at least they believe they're gods. They wrote a book 200 years ago detailing their instructions to reach them. To reach The Dream. 
 
 `` Control the dream to enter the dream to become the dream to control the dream.'' 
 
 These were the words we had to go on, studied, fought for in the last 120 years. Then one day in the house of Byrgenwerth I uncovered some of the writings of Master Wilhelm. `` Fear the Old Blood.'' 
 
 The Old Blood was a substance used to heal even the most horrible afflictions by the Church but eventually those who had tasted the cure of it invariably fell to madness, becoming beasts in mind as well as body. Lycanthropy, mutations, madness, these were the effects of the blood of the Old Ones. 
 
 I searched more in this desolate wasteland finding new information, Wilhelm wrote about `` insight'' something that peeled back the veil over this world showing the true horror and lighting the path to The Dream. I gathered as much of this Insight as I could, the veil slowly fading away almost like a decent into hell. Madness. 
 
 Then one day as I plunged into the heart of the fabled Church of Yharnam, slaying the beasts therein, I came across the text of an old hunter by the name of Gehrman saying the paths to the dream is the blood, if you can handle it. 
 
 So I did the only thing my family had n't tried, I submitted myself to the tender mercies of the Church, to a Blood Minister. I laid back on the table in Isoefka's clinic as the man spoke to me. He said `` Oh yes, the Old Blood, you've come to the right place. Whatever happens you may think it a mere bad dream... brace yourself hunter.'' 
 
 He injected the blood into my vein and the world swam and I saw only blackness with dark shapes and swirls crawling over my body with a sense of power infusing me. Power and panic. I felt hands clawing over my body, smaller than a child's light touch but deeper and more malevolent than cancer of the mind. 
 
 The darkness invaded again And I woke in the lecture hall. This is where you came in. The monsters here we're garbed like scholars. They fell just like the beasts I had hunted since I was a boy. I stood in front of the door and grabbed the handle. 
 
 I opened the door to see swirling purple and black lights, churning like oil on the lake. I stepped into the blackness to find myself standing in a graveyard with a chapel on the hill. 
 
 A woman stands before me next to a man in a wheelchair dressed in hunters garb. 
 `` Hello hunter,'' she said `` welcome to the Dream. This is Gehrman. He has been waiting for you.'' 
 
 `` So son,'' Gehrman drawled, `` you want to be a hunter?'' 
 
 And so my story begins again.

 `` Ha! Wrong name pal. Call me Lucy.'' A warm sweet voice called out. 
 
 Who? What is happening? Where is the voice? 
 
 `` Lucy! The Fallen One. You just died, honey. And I'm over here, open your eyes for me.'' She coaxes me. 
 
 I slowly blink a few times. I'm suddenly aware that I'm back in my childhood home. I can smell the drool-inducing scent of my father's waffles wafting through the old stucco house. I look over to see a blond woman, sitting at the corner of my bed. 
 
 `` Where am I? When am I?'' I stammer. 
 
 `` Why, you're in hell!'' She smiled warmly. 
 
 What? What? Actual hell? 
 
 `` That ca n't be right. This is my old home. I'm in bed. It's just you and I here. This has to be a dream.'' I reason out loud. 
 
 `` Oh trust me, honey. This is hell. I'm here to help you transition. See, hell is n't fire and brimstone. Not always. Some people live a heavenly life, but they live it poorly, and end up here. Their experiences tend to be of the torture garden variety.'' She patiently explained. 
 
 `` Then what about me? Am I on my way to a pain buffet?'' I asked nervously. 
 
 `` No. Others, like you, live a hellish life, and committed sins because of the situation you were put in, and yet still deemed unworthy of heaven. However I've always felt that `` hell'' can be loosely defined...'' she said with a smirk. 
 
 `` I do n't understand.'' 
 
 `` Lucy's Loophole. The man upstairs is still fuming because our main Hell property is dead these days. I've even turned it into my private music studio!'' Her eyes lit up at the mention of music. 
 
 `` You play?'' I was warming up to this Lucy. 
 
 `` Just harmonica.'' She smiled. `` Anyhoo! My loophole is I've developed these'personal hells' for individuals whom I have judged to have already gone through hell. I return these chosen to where they felt most safe and loved. You have been through enough, dear one. But should you ever grow lonely here, I give lessons on the main property!'' 
 
 I laughed. `` I may have to take you up on that sometime!'' 
 
 I gasped. It all went dark for a moment. My parent's home. My sister came back. She was off her medication. I was there for Mother's Day. She came with an axe, she just kept swinging it and screaming. Those blood curdling screams. My mom's and dad's mixing with my own. And then her laughter. Her harsh laughter grew more manic as did the puddle of blood around me. I ca n't. 
 
 Black. 
 
 `` Woah there! You alright?'' Lucy was cradling my head. 
 
 `` What happened?'' I panted. 
 
 `` Your transition. You ca n't be here for eternity without accepting the end to your past.'' She was so kind, I wished she would stay with me here forever. 
 
 `` I accept what happened, but that does n't make it okay. It does n't mean I'm okay...'' I trail off, tears threatening to spill over. 
 
 `` You're safe now. And if you'd like, I offer free therapy sessions in the main property, right next door to my music studio! I would love you to come by. Some music therapy is just what you need!'' 
 
 So kind. I closed my eyes. I am safe. I can move on. I can begin to heal. I am safe. 
 
 Soft harmonica cords floated through the air, and danced into my mind. 
 
 Safe.

 `` I...'' She began. 
 
 `` Stop,'' he said. 
 
 `` I ca n't,'' she replied. 
 
 `` You know... I'd do anything for you, right?'' He asked. 
 
 She nodded and then stood, staring down at the bag of oranges near the bed. They lay innocently, in a sack of red netting. Men would get down on both knees and worship such a find. Some would sell their own house, maybe even their wives, to hold such a sweet fruit. 
 
 He knew it, and she did n't have the audacity to care. 
 
 `` I'm confused Sam. You're forc-'' 
 
 `` I'm not forcing you to do anything,'' Sam hissed, `` it's what's right...'' 
 
 She reached down and plucked a plump orange into her hand. She gazed at the fruit. 
 
 Sam loved that gaze like he loved the taste of her lips. The sweet brevity of her kiss. And the feeling of her presence. Which was often taken away by the oranges, an addiction to the worst kind of illegal substance. 
 
 `` It's either me or them,'' Sam said. `` I ca n't marry a... a...'' 
 
 `` A what, Sam? An addict, be a man and spit it out!'' 
 
 Sam looked away, unable to meet her eyes. 
 
 She sighed. `` Biting into an orange is like... I ca n't even explain how good it is. It's all I think about, that juicy centre as sweet as honey. I want it across my tongue and down my throat, and on my chin. Just enough that I can lick it all up. It's the only thing I love as much as... as much as...'' 
 
 `` Liar,'' Sam said, it was all he could manage. 
 
 She picked up the sack of oranges and walked past to the room window. `` Fine, Sam, you want it to be this way? Just fine!'' 
 
 She flung the sack out. Sam looked up in shock. She stood over the window, and he could hear her crying. It broke his heart, so much so that all he could feel was the lump in his throat. 
 
 He walked up to her, his love, his woman, his future wife. `` Thank you, babe. You do n't know what this means to me. 
 
 He turned her around for a warm embrace. 
 
 And when she rotated, her eyes were filled with glee and her teeth were jammed into the biggest thickest juiciest orange he'd ever seen.

","I glanced at my watch with breathless anticipation. The digital face blinked 11:09 PM back at me. I could hear the wind as the rain poured outside the station. I had been waiting for this day for 21 long years, and finally I was at the train station where I would meet my wife for the very first time - again. 
 
 You see, I had a very strange... I suppose we'll call it a gift. It seems that everytime that I die, I return back to the day I was born. Then when I'm around three years old, the time that I begin to remember anything, all the details of my prior lives comes back to me. 
 
 11:10 PM 
 
 I remember my first life well. It was a short sad little thing, I was killed at the young age of 17 in a car accident. Suddenly I was reborn! Given a second chance! Well, you could be sure that the second time around I made sure to not get into that car! 
 
 11:11 PM 
 
 I remember that second chance. I remember that day, this day, at the train station. I was walking through the empty station when I saw her. Amber. She was getting off the 11:15 train. Somehow I managed to strike up a conversation with her, and even then it seemed that we were destined to be soulmates. I asked her number and we began dating. A short time later we were engaged and married. 
 
 11:12 PM 
 
 Amber was everything I could've hoped for in a companion. Funny, sweet, caring... I loved her for the best 10 years that anyone could've asked for. It was no surprise then, that I took her sudden death so hard. 
 
 11:13 PM 
 
 A call from the hospital. `` I'm sorry, but the cancer appears terminal.'' If only we had caught it sooner! But I knew. I knew my gift. I knew that I only had to die, and I would know! I could warn her! Soon after she passed away, and I put my gun in my mouth so that I could be reborn. 
 
 11:14 PM 
 
 Living through my third life was rather boring. I had some of the same teachers and friends, but I made a few different decisions to shake things up. When I was 15 I persuaded my parents to move to a nearby city so that I could explore a new place. However, through all my childhood and adolescence, I had this singular thought. I had to save Amber. That thought led me to this station, with my rain soaked jacket and trembling hands. Waiting. 
 
 11:15 PM 
 
 The train slid into the station. The doors opened, and the few passengers staggered onto the platform. And there she was. She was everything that I remembered. Everything that I had missed for 21 years. She was holding hands and leaning against a young man. With a ring around her finger. They seemed blissfully in love. `` No.'' I whispered. She was staring at him the way I remember her staring at me. I felt my fingernails dig into my palms as I watched them make their way unaware through the empty station. `` No.'' I said. They were almost out of the terminal. I shouted, `` No!'' 
 They both turned around, confused at me. I walked up to them, my voice choked up, my eyes watering and said to Amber; `` Wait, just a moment.'' I pulled some paper out of my backpack and scribbled a message on it, then folded it over and over. I handed it to her and said `` Do n't open this for a year or so.'' She looked at me strangely and warily took the paper from my hand. `` If you ever need anything,'' I stared intensely `` Anything! my number is on the paper. I love you Amber.'' She stared at me with wide eyed shock. 
 I looked away from them, turned up my collar and walked into the rain. With a small smirk as the tears fell I had the thought, `` Well I guess here is my third chance.''

","I expected him to break down the doorway by the hinges, burst through the wall and send shrapnel everywhere, or even just walk right in and have the Sun glaring from behind, casting his mighty silhouette on my figure. But not this time; no, those days were done. He simply opened the door and let himself in, not making a grand entrance like the good old days. He did n't show up in his bright blue and white suit, his cape flowing like it was colored wind; all he had on was a dark green shirt tucked in his khaki pants that looked one size too big for him. 
 
 He stared down at me, not moving from the doorway. It was n't that usual stare he gave that got the camera's flashing for the morning front page, this was one that got people's pictures on wanted posters. His eyes burned as he stared at me, his mouth quivering like he was about to blow me away again with his super breath. For a moment, I thought he was going to burn me away with those eyes of his, like he'd done with The Magistrate's arm back in the 80's. Poor bastard never did hold someone up the same way after that. 
 
 Yet it was n't just anger I saw in him. No, I could see something else, something was troubling him on the inside. I'd known pain, from myself to the people I worked with. I could always see past the charade these heroes put up for the public, I knew what they were hiding. I knew Mr. Plasma was crushed when his wife got chopped into bits by the Splicer, yet did n't show it the next day in the papers with him bringing Splicer to the police station in cuffs and some not-so-subtle bruises. I knew that Galactica was horrified when she failed to save those kids from the bus that fell off the cliff, yet she tried to mask her voice at the press conference by saying how those kids were so full of `` joy'' and `` hope'' and that this was the work of a villain rather than shitty city planning for road maintenance. Got ta impress those officials, I guess. 
 
 And here, standing in front of me, was no exception. 
 
 `` Why'd you do it?'' he asked, his voice trembling. `` Why did you have to go off and do it again?'' 
 
 I said nothing, just continuing to stare at his eyes on the verge of glowing. 
 
 `` I thought we agreed that there would be no more of this,'' he took a few hard steps forward, shaking the flowers on top of my dresser. `` You told me that yourself, right in front of the mayor and the citizens.'' Again, I gave him no response. 
 
 He brought his hands to his face, rubbing his temples as he walked around my room. He let out a loud sigh, as if trying to calm himself down. He eventually took a seat beside me, his hands clasped together like he was trying to keep them to himself and not around my throat like last time. 
 
 Our eyes met again, `` Just...'' He paused, looking away at me, choosing instead to stair at the dull carpet below. `` Where is it,'' he spoke in a whisper, `` where did you store it?'' 
 
 No response came from me. His eyes met mine, yet again, and that rage was slowly returning. 
 
 `` Goddamn it!'' he bolted up from the seat, sending a picture frame on my nightstand to fall on its face; I hoped it had n't been broken. `` Where is the money! The money you stole!'' 
 
 I said nothing. 
 
 He paced back and forth, each step vibrating the room. `` You told me that you would be done with this business, that you had finally decided to hang up the mask. Okay?'' He talked like some ammeter businessman trying to weasel himself into a deal that he had no clue about, negotiating with me like his life depended on it. `` That was years ago, and here I thought that we would finally,'' he threw his arms up in emphasis, `` be at peace and that we could spend the rest of our lives just like normal people.'' 
 
 `` But instead,'' he stepped in front of me and brought his head in, our noses just inches away, `` you pull this bullshit and here I find you nestled in your house like nothing happened! Like you think you're the king of the world and that you can just do as you please.'' 
 
 He shut his eyes, trying to regain his composure. `` I'll just ask you one more time,'' he spoke in a low and aggravated voice, `` where did you store the money?'' 
 
 We stared into each others eyes for a moment, as if this was a blinking contest to the death. Here he stood, America's hero, the friend to all, voted bachelor of the year in'75. Here was the man that everyone adored, who kids dressed up as, who journalists had to get on their knees and beg just for a few seconds of questions, who congressmen paid an entire family's worth of income in a year just for a state dinner. Here he was now, an ugly, liver spotted, balding man who was about two seconds away from ripping my fucking head off and impaling it on a spike. 
 All that was stopping him was his waiting for my answer. 
 
 He never got it. 
 
 He let out a mighty roar, cracking the window nearby and gave me a terrible ringing in my ears. He grabbed my shoulders, shaking me violently like a wine bottle at a party. `` WHERE IS IT!,'' he shouted, `` WHERE IS IT! WHERE IS IT! WHERE IS IT! WHERE IS IT! WHERE IS I-.'' 
 
 `` Mr. Godfrey!'' a voice shouted from behind, a female one. He stopped shaking me and looked behind, not letting me go. At the doorway stood a woman, mid-forties, wearing a white buttoned-down shirt and matching pants; her hair was tied back in a tight ponytail. Her shirt pocket had a few pens in it along with some kind of radio doohickey. `` What on Earth are you doing to Mr. Randall?'' 
 
 Godfrey let out what sounded like a mix between a cough and a laugh, though he finally did let me go; my shoulders were getting sore. `` That's not my name,'' he seethed, `` and I'll tell you what you what I'm doing, I'm stopping another crime from happening under your so-called watch.'' 
 
 `` And how is that?'' She sounded annoyed, crossing her arms like she was tired of this bullshit. 
 
 `` Well I'll tell you what,'' he pointed his finger at her. `` When I woke up this morning, I can swear to God that I had fifty cents in my coat pocket. I remember that because I bought a drink that cost exactly fifty cents and I put in a dollar.'' He kept poking his finger in his hand, trying to make a point. `` I remember that I had gotten back two quarters and I put them in my coat pocket.'' 
 
 `` Well,'' he stood straight like he was posing, `` when I checked my pocket, the money was gone. And I know that HE,'' he pointed towards me in an exaggerated fashion, `` was the only culprit who would steal my money!'' 
 
 The woman sighed, rubbing the space between her eyes. `` Mr. Godfrey, maybe you just misplaced your money.'' 
 
 `` Nonsense,'' he replied, `` my mind is greater than any human on Earth. I once lifted a ten ton object and threw it into the air by just thinking about it. My mind is perfect. And that is not my name, for my name is Captain Ironside!'' For a moment, I could swear the old hero I had fought years ago was showing himself again, though I looked at that old body and was brought back into reality. 
 
 `` Captain Ironside,'' the woman spoke with annoyance, `` if there is a problem, you need to come to us before you start making a scene. We ca n't have you running around in a rampage every week, now can we?'' 
 
 `` But-'' he stuttered. 
 
 `` Enough!'' she raised her voice, though kept a calm demeanor. She spoke behind her and two large men wearing the same ensemble she had on walked into the room and immediately held onto Godfrey's arms. `` Please take Mr. Godfrey to the ward and give him a dose of his medication; he forgot to take it again. Be sure to take him back to his room and keep a watchful eye on him.'' 
 
 The two large men dragged Godfrey out of the room, but not before he turned his head back towards me. `` Blasted,'' he said, `` You may have one this day, but just remember one thing. I will always fight for truth and justice and will vanquish lies and injustice. For my name is Cap-.'' The door slamming shut drowned out the rest of his speech. Thank God, I grew tired of hearing it over and over again. 
 
 The woman took a deep breath and began to pick up a few things that fell onto the floor; she readjusted the picture frame on my nightstand, which had a crack on the glass. I will admit, out of today's events, that's what saddened me the most. It was Lorna's last gift to me before she died, a picture from our wedding. 
 
 `` Do n't worry Mr. Randall,'' the woman spoke in a soothing voice, `` I'll make sure that we fix this right up, along with everything else in the room.'' Her smile seemed sweet, which looked a bit odd considering that she had just chased an old man out of my room. Yet I knew fake emotions, and I could tell that this was sincere. 
 
 `` Now are you hurt?'' she asked. I blinked once. `` Well alright then, I will have someone come check up on you, though, just to check up on your condition and make sure he did n't hurt you.'' 
 
 She reached over and placed her hands over my face, adjusting the mask that had gotten a bit eschew. Once that was secure, she had my sheets refitted over my body, carefully tucking me in. Then again, I could n't feel anything worth a damn under my head, but I did appreciate the effort. Once she was done adjusting my pillow, she pressed a few buttons on the remote on my bed and the overhead TV came on. 
 
 `` Now just relax and enjoy some TV while I get someone back here in a little bit. Now are you sure you do n't need anything else?'' I blinked twice, `` Well alright then, I'll be back as soon as possible.'' 
 
 She left the room, leaving just me and the talking heads on the news station. ``... and in other news,'' the reported with the noticeable wig said, `` the Bank of Westmire was struck again by a robber in broad daylight as...''

 “ Good, then Heart – you know what to be prepared for. ” Heart shuddered slightly at the thought of the massive amounts of MDMA he would have to put up with. Heart wasn ’ t in the best shape after all. 
 
 Brain put on his reading glasses and went down the list, checking off everything he thought they would have to be ready for. He was about halfway through the list when something strange began to happen. 
 
 “ So, uh guys. I think we ’ re all on the same page, but…uh…hehehehahahaHAHAHAHA. ” 
 
 All of the other organs looked at Brain strangely, 
 “ Sorry, um. SssssssHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! ” 
 Brain had completely lost his shit and was rolling around on the floor in hysterics. 
 
 “ Oh, no. Looks like Horatio ’ s been smoking weed again, ” said Pancreas. 
 
 “ Sh-shut up! ” Choked out Brain between fits of laughter, 
 
 “ You ’ re a v-vestigial organ! BAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!! ” 
 
 Everyone joined in with the laughter this time, even Liver, who was starting to catch a buzz. Horatio must have started early this morning.

","Life is a funny thing. We spend our entire lives, trying to figure out why we are alive. We want to know the reason for our existence. For some, it is being a successful and influential star. Others develop cures for diseases. A few go on to be evil, like Hitler killing millions of Jews. I, however, have no idea of what I want to do. I am a 19 year old college student with average grades. Many of my friends have internships at cool places and here I am, playing games on my laptop. Nobody wants a student with a 2.5 GPA. I feel like I have nothing to offer at all. I have ADHD, so it's hard for me to focus on anything. Anxiety and depression are slowly destroying my mind. The anxiety makes me worry about everything and depression makes it worse. I feel like I will never find someone who cares enough about me to stay in my life. I feel as if nobody cares about me in the slightest, except for when I can help them. Maybe that is my reason for existence. To help others feel better about themselves so they never feel the pain I feel every day of my life. 
 
 But even then, it still makes me worry. What if I fail? What if I do n't get the opportunity to help someone? I hate putting myself out there because I fear for being annoying or insistent. I want to keep people in my life but more often than not, I push people away unintentionally. 
 
 I never felt truly accepted. I was adopted when I was 3, and found out when I was around 10. When I found out about the abuse that led to me being adopted, I thought `` Even my own birth mother did n't want me.'' Playing soccer in high school was the only thing that kept me somewhat happy. But even then, not a lot of people accepted me. They said I was a terrible player. I did n't deserve to start. The only times they were nice to me was when I threatened to quit the team. That gave me a slight bit of assurance, knowing they needed me on the team. But it was n't enough. I still felt useless. 
 
 By the time I got to college, I felt like my life was headed in the right direction. Fresh start, new friends. But again, I figured out a way to unintentionally mess it up. Grades are falling, I thought maybe it was my gen eds, but I think it's the ADHD acting up again. I thought I had it under control for a while but its getting worse. Many people during rough periods get addicted to something, whether its drugs or alcohol or smoking. I became addicted to the internet and gaming. My life was seemingly perfect online, I had some decent friends and good times. But without it, reality sets in and I am terrified. 
 
 I really think I'm more scared of life than anything else. The fear of not knowing what the future has in store for me. It's weird, but nothing else comes close. My fear of sleep also exists and torments me. It's not the actual sleeping that scares me, but rather, falling asleep. You drift off into a near comatose state, where your heart rate drops and brain activity slows. You basically almost die and if something goes wrong, you possible could. Many times I have woken up in the middle of the night screaming from night terrors from my PTSD after the abuse, or I have woken up panting, in a cold sweat, barely being able to breathe. I was never diagnosed with asthma, but sometimes I ca n't breathe for periods of 5 seconds. Every day I might die and not leave a worthy trace of my life on this planet. So really, my biggest fears are tied between life and death.

33113,"[ WP ] A day in the life of a psychopath .
","You may be under the false impression that it is difficult to murder another human and escape without being nabbed, as the kids call it. I assure you that it is not. Murder, is easy. 
 
 
 On the murdering days I usually wake up close to four o'clock in the morning, and then pick someone to murder. Now, this is a crucial step as most people driven by their emotions choose to murder someone they know or have contact with. This is in fact a mistake most of the time. Obviously picking someone that you know or have contact with immediately puts you in the realm of possibility as a suspect, something generally to be avoided. Pick a city as your target city and drive there, no, do n't use a rental car, they require a credit card, are traceable, and most have GPS tracking devices on them. Make sure you own and drive a generic car, a Honda Civic or Toyota Prius, something that wo n't be noticed as out of place. 
 
 
 Now I must say something about picking a city and patterns, do n't leave a pattern. If you start with the cities closest to you and then work your way outwards it pinpoints the city you are in. Do commit at least one murder in your own city, not someone you know, and not your first murder, obviously. 
 
 
 Pick a house in a nice neighborhood, you'll want there to be distance between it and the neighbors. You'll have a silenced weapon of course, but they still make a fair amount of noise. Distance lets that sound die off, so that no one will be the wiser. Once you have the house picked out you'll need to do reconnaissance, but for all that is wrong in the world, do n't do it from your car on the street. Park somewhere a ways away and walk by the house occasionally, perhaps once every hour and a half. Do n't try and get fancy by tracking down the houses blueprints or permits for building it or other such nonsense. Even if you do manage to hold up that request through a city council on a fake name, people will have seen and remembered you. It's pretty easy to kill people once you're in their house and you can probably figure your way around just fine if you're not an complete fool. 
 
 
 On your walk bys try and figure out how many people live there and more importantly how many adults. Kids are easy, you can kill them or leave them, but they wo n't present a danger to you, only the adults will. 
 
 
 Be patient, if you feel that you do n't have a good bead on things by nightfall call it a day and head home, do not under any circumstances pick the same family again on another murdering day. You want to be in and out in a single day. If something else happens, run into an old friend in the town or are involved in a memorable incident anywhere in the town leave and work again another day. 
 
 
 Once you've made walk bys and have some knowledge of the house and people in it wait until near two in the morning. Most people will be asleep by this point and you should have little troubles from outside forces. Do night stay up eating in an all night diner and do not rent a motel or hotel room. Just drive yourself along a nearby freeway, out about twenty miles and then back in and whittle away the time. Gas stations have cameras, do not stop at them. 
 
 
 Once it is near two in the morning drive close to the location of the victims and park your car. As to what you'll be wearing, internally, skin tight latex, you can not allow DNA to be left at the scene. Over that, a new, unworn pair of jeans, blue, and a t-shirt and hoodie. On your head wear a swimmer's cap and then a full face mask over. The hoodie will hide that your face is masked while walking down the street to your victims location. 
 
 
 Carry two pistols at all times, both of them with silencers. Obtaining a silencer without arousing suspicion is a topic for another day, but I would note that many foreign countries are significantly more lax with their laws surrounding weaponry than the United States. Many of which can be driven to, and even inspections of a car are unlikely to find a device magnetically held to the undercarriage of a car if it's hidden behind some other key components. 
 
 
 The latex you'll have been wearing all day, obviously only put the mask on while on the last part of your drive to the victim's location. 
 
 
 Get out of the car and walk to the house. I ca n't delve into lock-picking, but in this instance, the movies are n't wrong and the average lock on a house is ridiculously easy to pick, two minutes maximum after practice, and you will need to practice. 
 
 
 Once in the house you'll need to rely on stealth. Move slowly and keep your pistol out at all times. On multiple storied houses bedrooms are almost always on the second floor. At this point, remember the exterior of the house to determine what is likely to be the largest room or master bedroom. Enter this room that you think is the master bedroom. Presuming that you've been quiet enough whoever is in that room should be asleep or just waking up due to the noise of the door opening. 
 
 
 Regardless, shoot them, in the head, twice. 
 
 
 At this point you may feel the urge to savor the way their blood pools into little lakes and traces across the floor like rivers and tributaries, but do not. Instead, remain silent and still. If anyone else has awoken you will here it and can simply wait for them to come to investigate, which they will. If you've just killed one of the children, in an average hetrosexual household, and I abhor the implication of sexism, but in my experience it is true, the father will come to investigate. Shoot him twice in the head as well. If you guessed correctly and are in the master bedroom shoot all the adults in the head, twice. If it takes more than two shots per individual you need to practice your aim at a firing range. If the father came to investigate and you have just killed him, move quickly to the door he left open, and he will leave it open, and kill the wife, again, two shots to the head. 
 
 
 At this point you can search for more children or leave. I recommend leaving, time is always our enemy. 
 
 
 After the killing, walk back to your car calmly, even if along your walk screams erupt from the house. Remember, no one can see you and you do n't look threatening until you're the one running. Get into your car and drive away, remember to take off the mask and cap after driving for a little while. 
 
 
 Oh, and do n't have your real license plates on your car, I mean, I almost hesitate to bring it up, but there are some in this world that are just that idiotic.

55714,"[ WP ] Your girlfriend has always hated you , and is constantly making attempts to ruin your life . However , everything she does inadvertently makes your life better . Today , ever oblivious , you propose to her .
","As you would expect with a young man and a young woman, who have spent so long with issues in regards to trust, they slowly begin to build trust with each other.. or so they thought. 
 
 At first they were both oblivious to any idea of attraction, both working at the same job, doing the best they thought they could considering the circumstances. The man was patiently waiting for his newborn daughter, and trying his best to make a path for her to walk on, while juggling attempts at making a real relationship despite the one night stand that caused the snowball of fate to form and start rolling. The girl, just wanting to finally find someone to replace all of the memories of her past from an'abusive' relationship. I could n't tell you what finally sparked the initiative in the girl to finally pursue the man, but that willingness to try attracted the man more than anything else he's ever seen. 
 
 Of course like any budding friendship or relationship it started small, first just making comments in passing, then small conversations. One day she finally figured out what to do, so she took the hat the man wears every day and hid her number inside of it. `` Wow, this is smooth'' the man thought as he whisked away to see why she was messing with his sacred hat, to find the slip of paper twirling on to the floor. He did n't wait the'three days standard' and messaged her that night. Next thing he knows, he's being asked on a casual date. The plans fell through, but that did n't stop them. They decided to find new plans and went to the movies, clearly nervous and unsure the man tried to act as casually as he could and stumbled his way through the date just hoping he did n't mess up his chance with someone he was so smitten by. 
 
 Days go by, and they quickly become closer and closer. Now together, it seems like nothing could get any better or worse. They were quite happy, and the man had no clue... 
 
 The day came so sudden, laying in bed with the girl, they were just casually chatting when the message came through, `` She's coming early, she will be born in the morning''. So the man without hesitation told her he needed to pack up and prepare for the long drive, and to let everyone know at work his daughter he's been yearning for is finally coming. 
 
 He makes it to the hospital, to find out he wo n't be in the room for the birth, upset he swallows the pain and waits patiently outside. The cries came, and then quickly stopped, three short cries and it hit him `` she's not breathing'' he thought. Doctors rushed in and out, and to save the pain, he ignored the nurses chatting outside. 10 minutes go by, he hears nothing, 20 minutes, what seemed like hours to him... three doctors come through the door, he knew before they even had to open their mouths. `` She did n't make it, i'm very sorry'' and after that the rest of it was such a blur to the man, nothing but tears and sorrow filled his day, and many days after that. 
 
 After taking his grievance leave, he tries his best to go back to work, all of the eyes are on him, and he is n't sure why, things seem different. Soon, it becomes evident through all of the back handed comments that he is no longer wanted at the job, and by the looks of it, it seems the girl he grew to trust so much might be the cause of it. Then the psychotic break came one horrid night, and they had a furious arguement ending in a split up that he could n't wrap his brain around with everything else going on, but blindly he tried to fix everything. `` I was going to get you a ring for being so caring while I went through my loss'' he told her to try and give her some comfort that he was n't a bad person, that he was just in a bad place. It was enough to make her want to try again, so she did. More and more despite that, things did n't unfold well for the man, and abruptly he was let go from a job he was trying so hard to love for his daughters sake, now with both out of his life he was completely lost. 
 
 `` Things could n't get much worse'' he thought, but they could, and they did. Soon the whole town had their eyes on him, and people were asking odd questions, he was n't sure if he was going crazy or if it really could be true that she was trying to eliminate him from her life. He never did get her the ring he was hoping to get, just to see what would happen he wore an old ring he found to see the reactions people would make. Even when he was still working he heard whispers `` is that the ring he was going to give her?'' she even asked where it came from, he gave her the truth, `` it's an old ring of mine, just decided to give it a test drive.'' and she assumed it was a silly lie but let it be. 
 
 The last time they ever spent time together, she tried asking for her favorite shirt of his, and he could n't seem to find it, and told her he would look for it so she could wear it the next time they were together. 
 
 She was getting fed up with waiting for the [ hopefully ] expensive ring and shirt to keep as momentos, one morning she was just done with him completely, after a long message the man sent begging for stability in the relationship, practically stating he was wanting to marry her one day if it came down to it. He knew there was no good at play, and had to pull the last straw and lay the cards on the table, gave it his all in the last message he ever got to send her, even though he was half a sleep from passing out on the front porch from exhaustion after being awake for two days trying to put all the pieces together. 
 
 He woke up, and saw there was no response on his phone, so he checked his social media.. She had completely blocked him out of everything, like he never existed. 
 
 `` I have seen it all in the palm of my hands, and now the future has crumbled to peices, nothing left but the existance of a walking husk. Existance means nothing once you become a ghost to society, so a new path will have to be carved, or wither away and die to the deeds of a women you were learning to cherish and love.'' 
 
 After weeks of trying to figure out everything, the man gave up and on a whim decided to apply for a'semi-dream' job. 
 
 He got it, and is now happier than ever. 
 
 the end. [ bitch ]

143705,"[ WP/IP ] Street kids in a over crowded slum city where resources are strung to there limits .
","My shift begun. 
 
 8 hours robbed each day, 56 a week, 2920 a year. When it is over, I can return to the pits below the southern street car park. There, a mildly warm bowl of a gruel will greet me, and that thought encompassed my entire motivation to be here. 
 
 Here, I could survey the entire fletcher slums, and more importantly, the only transit stop in this district. Twice a shift ( 4:47 and 8:25 precisely ) an armoured train would stop briefly, before ejecting a single pallet of aid onto the station square. With an old AMR-2 sniper rifle, I was entrusted with preventing anyone but the leaders from approaching the pallet of oats, potatoes and wheat. Sent from those wishing this situation would solve itself. 
 
 I was the obstacle the hopeless hopefuls hated. The ones unwilling, or unable, to join the gangs and do jobs akin to my own. Six times a day when the pallet arrived, they would sprint, as fast as their undeveloped legs could, until myself, or one of the other snipers found them. 
 
 4:45, nearly here. The scrap metal tracks rocked the misaligned braces. We repaired and maintained them ourselves. We had to, or the trains would n't come. 
 
 4:47 Brakes screeched through the rotting metropolis. Every eye was on the station. Crowding on rooftops, perched on fences and landscape, in a certain kind of awe that desperation brings. 
 
 The first broke off from behind the second terminal, he was followed by a few other dreamers. Only the quick and lucky had stolen without retribution, but rumours said one box could last a soul a month, so there was always those that would try. I mean, You could travel. You could escape, and live like you were supposed to. If I ran, could I make it? Could I make it away? Would the other snipers look down their sights falter or hesitate? 
 
 I knew the runners game. The trick was to not stop moving until you were directly beside the square. There, a few high rise shelters enabled cover from the snipers. But you could n't stay there forever, you had to expose yourself to the square, the pallet, the prize, before returning from where you came. The dirt. 
 
 Only one had made it thus far. Ripping a single box from the sixty or so on the pallet. He entered my sights, bright blonde hair, bony cheekbones, one hand a stump. Probably the reason he took the run, with posts which provided adequately rare, such a disfigurement was guaranteed unemployment in this job market. 
 
 He could sprint and weave though, strong legs and good focus. He was definitely younger than me by a few years. If he succeeded, he could make it out of here. Off the once green plains. To somewhere plentiful, where he could create a life worthy of youth. 
 
 I pulled the trigger. A sniper never faltered or hesitated. Not when a mildly warm bowl of gruel was on the mind.

75525,"[ WP ] You are a time traveller , everyone knows you 're a time traveller from old pictures/videos/newspapers where you openly admit the fact and when/where you 're born ... However , you are n't a time traveller yet and do n't know how you go back in time .
","Nobody knows their own future. At least that's what I always assumed. I guess I never really thought about it, or else I would have noticed that there was one person who knew exactly what this life would hold for him. 
 
 Of course, everybody knows about the time traveller. You are probably tired of hearing about Simon, since there is not one chapter in your history book where he does n't show up. Every important event, he was there. Simon was there when the octogons in Egypt were built, when the greeks snuck their giant hamster was into Troy, when Hannibal crossed the Alps with camels, when President Kennedy barely escaped that bullet only to later tragically choke on one of his wife's famous pigs in blankets. He witnessed it all. And who knows, maybe he even had an impact on many events and we would live in a completely different world if it had n't been for him. 
 
 Unlike most kids, I never particularly liked Simon. I shared everybody's fascination with his ability to time travel, but this was always paired with resentment. Why had he not done anything to prevent all the terrible events in history? If he knew the future, could he not have known that the Titanic would sink? Sure, he organized the evacuation and all that, but why not keep the ship from hitting that iceberg in the first place? And how could someone who spent years being Hitler's barber not have done anything to prevent the Holocaust? The only explanation to me was, that Simon was a malicious tourist in the past, taking joy in watching all these disasters and atrocities unfold. 
 
 It never occured to me that I could be him, despite the fact that I knew he was born the same year I was. Not until that day in September in fourth grade when I got into a fight with Billy. Ironically, that was also the day Simon died. Nobody had seen him in decades, let alone met him. But that day he was all over the news and it became clear that he had become completely insane. Insanity and the capabilities of someone who experienced most of humankinds history became a fateful combination for those ten men he silently killed at Boston airport before being shot five times by the police. It was later ruled a hate crime, though the media hype at the time hindered investigations and there are a bunch of conspiacy theories about what really happened. 
 
 You see, I'm generally a very agreeable person and you may think that a fourth grader is incapable of truly hating someone. Yet, as long as I can remember, I had disliked Simon. And that day, I started hating him. The only person fourth grade me hated more was Billy. I think, part of it was that we shared the same first name – Richard – though I went by Rick and he called himself Billy. Anyway, I do n't remember what started that particular fight and it does n't matter. All that matters is that Billy and I were in the old factory where we were not supposed to go. When he pushed me, I hit my head on one of the rusty barrels and sliced my forehead open pretty bad. Billy ran off ( but not before puking on my shoes because apparently he ca n't see blood ) and my mom had to take me to the hospital to get stitches. Eighteen stitches across my face and although the doctors assured us that it would soon look better, my mom and I both knew that it would leave a nasty scar. 
 
 After getting the stitches, we thank the doctors and make our way back to the car, passing through the ER's waiting area. All the TV's are on and Simon's face is on every single one of them. Mid fifties, brown eyes, brown hair, rugged beard. And that weirdly shaped scar across his face. I freeze. I had seen that face, that scar, hundreds of times before. But not that way. My mother looks at me, surprised at first, then worried, then fearful, and I know she sees it too. That same scar as on that killer's forehead, being thrown at us from seemingly hundreds of screens all around us, is now gaping on my own forehead. 
 
 I do n't remember much after that. I did n't want to talk to anyone about what had happened and maybe I was too young to fully understand. I think throughout my childhood nobody ever made the connection between me and Simon. Had he not been on the news that day, I may not have noticed it myself. I never got to talk to my mom about the events. I remember her coming into my room that night. She sat on my bed, looking at me – or through me, lost in thought, trying to find the right words. All she ever managed to say was: „Richard, promise me you will never kill someone. Promise me this. “ And I nodded, „I promise “. 
 
 Those were the last words I ever said to her. She never got around to telling my dad about who I would become. She died the very next day in the great earthquake of New York when the World Trade Center collapsed. 
 I thought about Simon a lot that day. Why would he come back to kill ten innocent people, but not to warn my mother – his own mother – and all those other people about the tragedy ahead of them? I ca n't even say I hated him that day. I just felt so numb when all these things happened. 
 The next day, I got a letter. No sender was marked on the envelope, but it was stamped in Boston, so I knew it had to be from Simon. 
 
 *Dear Rick, * 
 
 *I hope and pray everything in your life is alright and well. But if it is n't, I know there are no words that can console you right now. 
 I know many things may not make sense to you right now, and believe me, most of them never will. I wish I could give you all the advice in the world, but I do n't want to cheat you out of making your own experiences. * 
 
 *All you need to know is this: I left the time machine in the old factory. The one where you hit your head just recently. It's well hidden, but you will find it. No use trying it yet, though. I turned it off for a few more years. You're a kid, you should n't be time travelling. * 
 
 *Once you turn eighteen, feel free to travel wherever you want. I know you're thinking about never using it at all to keep all this from happening, but I know you will use it one day. And do n't worry too much about where the time machine came from. I got it the same way you did and it still messes with my head when I think about it. * 
 
 *I'm sorry I broke the promise you just gave to your mother. Do n't feel guilty – you did n't do it, I did and I had to. I know these are the darkest days of your life, but you have a great future ahead of you. * 
 
 *Love* 
 
 *Simon* 
 
 I remember tearing up that letter, being angry at myself for having read something written by Simon. I was afraid of becoming him. For years, I did everything I could to hide that scar, and I dyed my hair just to look a little bit less like that maniac. I avoided all history books. And most importantly, I stayed away from the factory where the machine that would allow all these events to unfold was hidden. 
 
 For a long time my life seemed empty. I knew who I would grow up to be and I dind't like that person. And most importantly, there was nothing new and exciting to life any more. All the things I would do in my life, everything I would achieve, all the events I would experience were already history. I had read about them, heard about them, seen pictures and videos. Sure, it would be nice to actually be there. But my life would lack everything novel and surprising. 
 
 I did n't go back to the factory till I was eighteen. And even then I had no intention of actually time travelling. The factory was where it all started and that's where I wanted it to end. This was my way of taking control of my life and not taking the path that Simon had laid ahead of me. You know, when you want to kill yourself, having a time machine is convenient. I could just travel away from it all and do what had to be done somewhere where none of the people who still cared about me would ever find my body. My dad had suffered enough, I did n't want to put him through the pain of knowing that his only son had taken his own life. 
 
 I had no problems finding the machine and set it to the most dull and boring time and place you can imagine. To me, that was midieval Scotland, but as I told you, I had so far shunned all knowledge of history. 
 
 What happened next was a complete surprise. I will not tell you too much about my time in the Highlands. Your history teacher probably told you more about it than you ever wanted to know. And if not, you can just pick up a book about it. But you know, they never tell you what it's actually like. You learn all about these events, but you never taste the food, or smell the wind, or hear the songs. And you never get to know the people. Sure, you hear about Cleopatra, and Napoleon, and Einstein. But nobody had ever told me of Norma. That's not even her real name, but it's what I called her. We did not speak the same language. Not when it comes to words that is. But there was a bond between us that words could never describe. She was the one who brought me back from wanting to end it all to having a hunger for this world and all the great experiences it holds. 
 
 If things had turned out differently, I would have stayed with Norma and abandoned the time machine for ever. But that's another one of life's twists that I did n't see coming. The short time we had together has changed me. I no longer dread living a life that I have heard about before. I know now that the important things are often not the big events documented in history books but the countless little moments that can only be experienced and never be accurately described. I do n't resent Simon any more. In fact I have taken on his name. I do however plan on doing things a bit differently than he did. Maybe he had a reason for breaking the promise he made to our mother. And yet I hope I wo n't do the same. But that's still a few decades away. As for now, I will be travelling to ancient Egypt. I do n't knwo if Simon had anything to do with them building those giant octogons, but I will see if I can convince them to build Pyramids this time. What a sight that would be!

All of that and more all at once and all in turns. Indescribable. Unbearable. The place shifts around you. Or, at least it would if time meant anything here. Moments seems stacked on each other while at the same time seem spread apart so they can never quite touch and lead to each other. There are no discernible light sources but, somehow, everything is lit and visible. Or at least felt. Or maybe merely known but known as a fragment that, though small, overflows your mind so that it is impossible to grip. So you let go and an echo of yourself from a very long time ago takes shape. You grasp it and try to force the specter to hold its shape long enough for you to be you again, at least in memory.

You are merely uncomfortable.'' and the mad cacophony of blistered space and time and thought coalesce into a blessedly solid and continuous instant. `` But first...'' 
 
 You feel... human. The memory of the place you were slips and the lush surroundings of what appears to be a palace takes its place. Before you, on an over sized throne is a man. A well dressed man with a smile that seems friendly and inviting. An old friend. You sit in a comfortable, firmly cushioned chair in clothes that feel lush against your skin. 
 
 `` Hello.'' purrs the man before you. He's beautiful. Flawless. You smell flowers carried in the light breeze through the two story tall windows behind him and get glimpses of a garden that stretches as far as you can see through the billowing white curtains. 
 
'h-Hello.'' You stammer. 
 
 `` I am delighted you chose to join me.'' the man said with easy grace. `` We do n't have long, I fear. I am quite busy lately. But I wanted to make time for you. I owe you that much for your service.'' 
 
 You manage to nod. `` Thank you.'' 
 
 You are transfixed. You can not remember who you are or how you got here. All you know is that you would happily stay here forever. God himself could n't be so perfect as that man. 
 
 `` I find,'' said the Morning Lord `` that you, and I mean the Royal you, humanity,'' -- with a flash of sharpened fangs at the distasteful word, ``... hold no answers for me. But His influence can be seen in other ways. I find your questions are far more enlightening. So I offer you a final gift for your service, and I expect you to service me in return. You may have one, final question.'' 
 
 `` One...'' you begin. 
 
 `` Ah, ah, ah!'' He shakes a finger. `` You almost lost it you little fool.'' he said in a way that made fool almost a sweet term of endearment. 
 
 `` Oh. Of course. Sorry.'' 
 
 `` Now, think little one. Think of one question that you would like answered before you must pass beyond all.'' Lucifer leaned back and waited with all of the patience of an exquisite statue. 
 
 You knew you should have thought long about your question, to extend your time in this place. The tug of what was coming was tearing at the edges of your current womb of tranquility. So many questions were already answered just by being here, in this room. But the question was there and you knew it was the one and the Dark Lord would not be kept waiting and your mind longed to please him. 
 
 `` Will I ever end?'' 
 
 Satan laughed. And with that laugh the comfortable womb was torn open and seven Devils sat in one place, superimposed and shifting and laughing. One with onyx black wings and horns, one of belching pustules, one of stinging flies, one of pure light, one of animal heads and feet, one a giant beyond reason, and one a great snakelike dragon. 
 
 And around you is Nothing. You fall. You wonder why you expected Satan to answer. He only wanted the question. He has that as surely as your soul and you gave both willingly. 
 
 `` No, you will not end. You, little fool, are God's chosen and cut from him. You will suffer as I suffer. God wills it. I will it. God created ME as perfect. Perfection demands forever. Perfection demands everything. You are mine, little one, and you will suffer until I have God. You will suffer always. I will find God in you and make Him suffer. I will show God his flaws and it will take until the end of time. I have delayed your suffering to give you this answer, the only answer I have ever given any soul. I hope it reaches Gods ears. You will cherish it, always, through the Hell of Suffering you've earned. I'll be waiting at the end that never comes. I am already there.''

","“ You come back. ” 
 
 The man who asked the question does not respond at first, trying to mull it over in his mind. He rolls the words around inside his head, attempting to parse meaning he might understand from them. Yet after a short while, he stops. He could try and riddle it out for the rest of his life, or he could just ask. 
 
 “ Sorry, could you be a little clearer? ” 
 
 God -a being indescribable and ineffable in its existence- shifts slightly. It is a very human thing, thinks the man. 
 
 “ You come back, ” God says again. “ Life is created, lives and learns, and when it comes time, it returns to its source again. ” 
 
 “ What source? ” 
 
 “ Me. ” 
 
 The man stares forward, slowly realizing the implications, but still rather confused. God, omnipotent as it is, sees this and grants him mercy. 
 
 “ You came from me in spirit, and you will one day return to me as well. At the end of your days, you shall gather back with me and share all you know. There will be no god and man, there will be only one, and that one remains until it is decided there is more to experience and know and another life is created. ” 
 
 A quiet follows, and the man considers this. It could be considered good or bad, depending on how one looks at it. It's almost poetic, even. 
 
 God creates Man, and Man creates God.

25536,"[ WP ] Aliens come to ask us what we did to the dinosaurs .
","It was very unexpected. One day the sky turned dark around 2 PM and no one knew why. It was more than just an overcast, it was straight up aliens. Their ship had taken up most of the viewable sky, stretching from California to some parts of Russia and Egypt. In the past 24 hours, everything has been an uproar on social media, political offices, and most importantly, space centers. 
 
 It was quite surprising that despite their intimidating technologies, the lanky domeheads only ( barely ) knew how to communicate using humanoid body language. It was in the Pentagon surrounded by military, government officials, and scientists that they used those similar lanky hands to draw a very rough T-Rex and looked up at the confused faces staring with such a glimmer of hope. 
 
 `` Fuck, you do n't think they KNOW about dinosaurs do you?'' gruffed a man with many stars and stripes on his uniform. 
 
 President John F. Kennedy twiddled his thumbs. `` Guys, you've got ta be kid'n me. I only got sworn into office two days ago!'' He looked at the two, their spherical eyes reminding those of bugs. `` Someone call a paleontologist. I swear I'm gon na resign.'' 
 
 A special team was flown out from Washington, bringing one of the smallest dinosaur they had. The 3 ft fossil stood quite small in comparison to the aliens, and they almost had to sit down completely to get eye level with the fossil. 
 
 The two professors that were most hands on with the aliens were profusely curious about them just as much as the aliens were curious about their long lost friends. While one professor was pointing at digitalised pictures of T-Rexes and Compsognathus, the other two were still standing by the fossilized donosaur. 
 
 `` What are we going to do? All they care about are the dinosaurs *and we've only got so much information on those dead things.'' one hissed. `` Mr. President, what's going through your mind? What do we do?'' 
 
 Kennedy sat with his arms crossed in his chair, leaned back. `` Listen, whatever we do, we got ta find out where they came fr-'' 
 
 A shrill cry interrupted. `` N- Do n't do that!'' The horror on everyone's face was insurmountable as the alien pulled the femur and made the entire thing collapse into a pile of scattered of dinosaur bone broth: dust, bone meal, and fragments in almost every direction. Everyone was frozen except for the Secret Service who tensed up at Kennedy's side, waiting for an outrage or to be zapped out into space without a spacesuit or something. But instead the domehead aliens both let out their own cry, except theirs sounded almost melodic with glee. 
 
 There was am audible sigh of relief, and the domehead aliens ended up leaving with the paleontologists back to Washington since they would n't speak or have anything other to do with dinosaur fossils. 
 
 It took about roughly two weeks for the team in Washington to go completely missing. The higher-up's never got a status update from them after a couple of days, and the SWAT team eventually found out everything was wiped bare. It was n't until another 4 weeks until the aliens had wiped all of the dinosaur fossils in museums and laboratories alike in all of North America, Asia, and Europe. People were terrified to walk out of their homes, and paleontologists either switched careers, hid away from everyone they knew and started a new identity, or they were just simply gone. There have still been no leads up until this day.

","As the suns ’ golden rays filter down through the forest canopy, the shadow of the fox is cast over its human charge. Looking down, the fox nudges the child with its cold nose. Seeing no reaction, the fox gently paws at the young one ’ s face. Cold. Nearly ice cold. The child will die soon, if not found by others of its kind. 
 
 
 Slowly looking up, the fox looks off to the horizon, studying the distance with great interest. It is not until the fox hears words, that its revere is interrupted. “ N-No Abigail, ” the voice says. The fox turns towards the sound, cocking its head at the purple suited being before it. “ Absolutely not, missy. What did I say? No. You are not getting that rifle; only bad things could come of it. ” 
 
 
 Sighing, the figure rubs his forehead, groaning softly. “ Listen, Abigail. I-I got ta let you go. I ’ m at a job. I ’ ll call you later. ” The figure takes his hand from his head and presses his thumb on a long metal device. Shaking his head, the figure looks up and smiles tightly. “ That woman.... ” he mutters, before stomping over to the fox. 
 
 
 Holding the metal device flat in the palm of his hand, the figure presses another button. A holographic image appears which excites the figure to no end. The figure looks from the holographic image, to the body of the dying child, and back to the image again, before smiling so widely his face nearly splits in two. Putting away the metal device, the figure pulls out a golden pocket watch, which shines in the early morning light. 
 
 
 “ Right on time, Princess Annabelle, ” the figure says, while looking at the watch. “ I ’ ve been tromping through these woods, falling into rivers, and getting dirt on my new shoes, but I ’ ve made it just in time for your death. And, by the way, your death will probably spark a violent and bloody war; I can ’ t wait. ” Chuckling, the figure extends his right arm with its palm facing towards the child. Seemingly out of thin air, the figure calls forth an ebony handled scythe, gripping it as soon as it is materialized. The figure pulls the scythe closer, wrapping both hands around it, before winding back for a powerful swing. “ Here we go kiddo! ” 
 
 
 The fox calmly looks at the figure, even as the scythe rapidly approaches. The scythe slicing silently through the air suddenly stops, slamming into some sort of shield which surrounds both fox and child. Blinking, the figure pulls back and slices from the other direction. Again the scythe is halted. Growling, the figure raises the scythe above his head, bringing it down will all of his might. The scythe makes contact with the shield again, but this time, a force sends the figure flying back into the forest behind it. “ Ow, ” the figure groans as it sits up, “ that wasn ’ t supposed to happen. ” 
 
 
 A low chuckling echoes about the forest, one that causes the figure to still. The figure turns slowly towards the fox—which he seems to have noticed for the first time—his eyes going wide. “ Always so brash and brutish, Death. Sit. Relax. You must catch your breath. ” The very air around the forest vibrates with this deep and commanding voice. 
 
 
 “ You, ” Death says, slowly bringing himself to a standing position. “ What are you doing here? ” 
 
 
 The fox cocks his head at Death, almost smirking. “ What I am doing here is none of thou ’ s concern, though it might be best for thou to suddenly adjourn. ” 
 
 
 Death rolls his eyes and crosses his arms, “ I have a soul to collect. The brat is practically dead anyway. ” 
 
 
 The fox looks down at the child while speaking to Death, “ Her life lies in your hands much like Time lies in Cronima ’ s sands. But, Death you must know, I control it all as above and so below. ” Nearly smirking again, the fox looks up at Death once more. “ Princess Annabelle will live to do great things. She ’ ll start wars and kill off kings. You will spare her life so she may grow to bring you the war that you wish to know. ” 
 
 
 Growling, Death nods his head in a defeated manner. “ Fine, I ’ ll let the brat live. It better be a damn good war. ” 
 
 
 The fox nods his head, “ of course, Death, would I lie? I know how much you love to watch things die. ” Death grumbles and inclines his head, before turning and stomping back through the forest. The fox turns back to the child, resting his paw on it. “ Awaken now child, awaken and thrive. You must awaken and come alive. ”

233256,"[ EU ] The Sorting Hat catches fire when placed on this one student 's head .
","It's been a full year since He Who Must Not be Named was defeated, and yet this school still feels like it's constantly under construction. 
 
 I suppose it's understandable. For all the spells we use to repair pre-existing things, I do n't know of any that can conjure centuries-old bricks out of thin air. 
 
 As I walked into the Great Hall to watch the first-years' Sorting ceremony, I passed by some bloke using a Mending charm on a few chandeliers and making a load of noise. Maybe the racket would drown out the drones of the Sorting Hat - these things are always a bit too slow and dry for my tastes. 
 
 I sat at the edge of Hufflepuff's table with a few friends and tried to stay awake as the names began to blur together. All was running smoothly - no surprises, just the same as any other year - when suddenly the Hat appeared to choke on its own words. 
 
 `` Oh, dear. Oh, my, my, my. This will not do - this simply shall not...'' 
 
 Without warning, the sputtering, shaking Hat burst into flames. Professor McGonagall cast Aguamenti and the Hat flew to the ground, wheezing all the while. 
 
 `` This student... is a great... danger to all of you. He must... be watched carefully... for I sense great darkness within him.'' 
 
 Everyone chattered nervously as Hagrid ushered the terrified student from the Hall. McGonagall coughed, dusted off the Hat, and decided to resume as though nothing happened. 
 
 No one saw that kid for a couple days - in fact, hardly anyone saw him during the whole year save for a couple passersby in the hallways. But as soon as the Hat ignited, and broke the monotony of years of Sorting ceremonies, I knew I had to find him. 
 
 * 
 
 It just so happened that I bumped into him on the Grounds coming back from a late autumn Quidditch match. It took me a second to realize it was him, but as soon as I did, I grabbed his shoulder. 
 
 `` Are you... the flames kid?'' 
 
 He did n't make eye contact and tried to shuffle away. 
 
 `` Hey, hey, I'm not gon na hurt you. The name's Randall. What's yours?'' 
 
 The boy coughed but still did n't say anything. 
 
 `` Really, mate, I'm just curious. I do n't intend to spread rumors or anything of the sort.'' 
 
 He sighed and glanced up at me. 
 
 `` I ca n't stand this bloody school. I wish I could just get transferred, but Mum wo n't hear it.'' 
 
 `` Well... I'm sorry you feel that way. What house did you, uh, end up in?'' 
 
 `` None of them. They've been giving me private classes - just me - with a bunch of adjunct professors. I mean, most of them are OK, but I'm not meeting anyone! And from what I hear, the Ministry of Magic has me on a watch list now! I ca n't even travel without having my entire past looked into!'' He looked at the ground again, then muttered under his breath: `` I'm not a bloody Dark Lord.'' 
 
 I tilted my head. `` Come again?'' 
 
 `` I said I'm not a bloody Dark Lord! Everyone's so paranoid around here! And you know why?'' 
 
 He poked me in the chest. `` It's because I'm one of the seven unlucky wizards alive on this Earth who just so *happens* to be named Tom Riddle!'' 
 
 He turned around, raced towards the castle, and ducked through a back door. 
 
 As I wandered back to the dormitories, I suddenly did n't feel so bad about having to sit through Sorting ceremonies once a year. Compared to that poor sod, I'm practically in the lap of luxury.

 They came on December 21, 2012, Peacefully enough. They landed in a florid field of poppies outside Washington D.C and for the first week were wary of everyone and anyone that tried to contact them. Of course there were the fanatics that would come from far and wide just to see a fake alien landing, but this was the real thing, they came from all over the world just to catch a glimpse of them. And the aliens, they didn ’ t give them the time of day. They just kept walking out, taking samples of sticks, leaves, and grass. They seemed to much prefer a reclusive lifestyle over the glitz and glamour that usually comes with foreign objects. They only ever left their area to gather samples. Grass, leaves, dirt anything that could tell them the chemical constructs of our world they wanted. Our scientists and politicians had tried to reach out to them, telling them that we only wanted peace and that we would do anything in our power to help them with whatever they had needed. they simply brushed it off thinking nothing of it. They seemed to have camaraderie to themselves to never talk to the humans. However, the cats they were very interested in. They would attract hundreds of them at a time, then they ’ d pick them up and walk them into their ship, talking to them like they were telling them an anecdote to calm them down even though the cat only expressed pure jubilation. In the beginning the government had tried to suppress the information that was being given out to the media, but soon it was clear that there was no covering this up. The whole world knew about it within a matter of hours, and the response was not pretty. The world went into unrest as people began to question what the aliens true intentions were. Did they want our most precocious children? Or were they out to vindicate some wrongdoing that out novice ancestors had done? we would find out when the aliens took off a year later with 80 % of the worlds cats.

169970,"[ WP ] Unbeknownst even to him , George W. Bush has been receiving visions of the future his whole life . In a Nostradamus-like turn , the ridiculous things he was famous for saying begin to make perfect sense over the next hundred years .
","November 26, 2026 
 
 It has been years since the conclusion of the previous `` War on Terror''. To most, this was a seemingly endless conflict in the middle east. The real problem? The fish, or perhaps the planet. That's why we were there. That's where it all started. 
 
 They ( or it? ) had been plotting for years, or at least so we thought at first. Science has n't managed to fully explain it yet, but it happened. By some unusual force of mother nature, the Earth has been fighting back. Thus far, it was managed to be kept under wraps by the highest levels of government worldwide. 
 
 Pollution was never the cause of climate change, although it was a small piece in the root cause behind nature's increasing hostility towards mankind. Everything had to be heavily guarded with great regard, else mass panic would erupt - mass religious hysteria - the world would crumble if the general populace ever learned the truth. 
 
 Intelligence agencies had been fighting night and day to prevent such from getting out - one of the most infamous leaks just after the war had begun revealed HAARP was entirely made up and conspired, the populace fed proverbial breadcrumbs of verifiable information that could lead one to conclude the government was behind such disasters, although, this was indeed not the case. The governments of the world were, in fact, the only thing keeping us alive. 
 
 By rose, it meant everything - water levels, numbers, and ferocity. 
 
 One man saw it coming well before it happened; George W. Bush. It was scoffed at when first mentioned, a crude parody of great ridicule. Little did they know - the fish - were the cause of the modern world's greatest natural disasters. Katrina was a direct result of the fish. Generating heat, mass rotary motions in the ocean. Madness. Hurricane season was convenient to the fish, more so than climate to generate these storms. 
 
 The worst? The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami combo. Their greatest tool, the reason the world is now in shambles. We're still unsure how they managed to generate such percussive force, well, what's left of us anyway. It's as if mother nature herself assisted them directly. A mystery nonetheless. 
 
 He tried to save us, he really did. It was hopeless - even with 8 years of massive intelligence oversight and military black project spending, the theory's forefather was unable to get to the bottom of it. The disasters stopped for 16 years after his presidency, it seemed as though they were able to detect he was our leader. 
 
 Well, it seems as though they just needed time, and we handed it right over to them. We're stuck in high elevations. There's not many left, if it were to gauged, it's estimated 1 % of the world's population escaped. Honestly, I do n't even think that many made it. 
 
 This may be the last time I'll be able to make an entry. Maybe the last day a human being walks on this wicked planet.. or perhaps, we're the wicked ones - being cleansed by something much more powerful than we could have ever hoped to have fought. Either way, tomorrow, we're making a last ditch effort. 
 
 It's us, them, or all of us.

 **** 
 Buildings tower over me like monoliths. Great, and dark, crumbling. Even now, bricks tumble to the cracked ground. There ’ s no light through the still clouds. No wind howling; only the crunch of my footsteps on broken glass and slipping rubble. Clutching my body, I shiver as I move through the city. I ’ d heard the stories; how it had once been the centre of the human race. A hub for culture and enlightenment, a place where science and freedom of speech thrived. Now not even ghosts graced this place. All around me, where small mounds of brick, metal and concrete. 
 
 My head twisted and turned, staring into the gloom between buildings. I peered through barren trees, their branches wizened. In the darkness at my feet, I could see movement. Small creatures flitted about my shoes. Were they perhaps curious of this new visitor. I raised my gaze and saw it then. A horizontal crescent gleaming, as though projecting light all by itself. It was like all the rubble surrounding me had come together, skittering across the broken road, and solidified around my shoes. Staring forward and frozen, the queer grin approached. 
 
 Clenching my fists, I hadn ’ t realised how cold and wet they ’ d grown. I tried to be brave. My eyes were zeroed in on the smile. As it came closer, I could see the state of it more clearly. Black gums, teeth brown and rotting, some missing. A clink sounded through the dark. A figure was slouching into view, dragging old chains behind it. Atop its head sat a crown. Dark orange lines stained the person ’ s – or creature ’ s – forehead. It leered at me as it got closer. I scrunched up my nose. It was like rotting flesh; whether it was human I didn ’ t know. 
 
 It was close now, circling me. I tried to follow it. If I let it out of my sight what might happen? My head twisted and turned over my shoulders when it moved behind me. Grey skin dripped like melted candle wax off sunken cheek bones, and there were only black holes were eyeballs should have been. There was a sound, like all the air being sucked in from around me. I tried to breath, and my lungs struggled for a second. I took a deep breath when I could, gasping. 
 
 ‘ A visitor. ’ My ears were pinned back in fear as it screeched next to me. With a new found speed, it swept in front of me. I stared straight ahead at it. ‘ What is your offering? ’ Offering? I didn ’ t have an offering! I couldn ’ t find my voice. I was pretty sure it ’ d been sucked out of me by now. I tried to move my legs. The rubble didn ’ t shift. ‘ Offering! ’ It moved side to side, swaying. 
 
 ‘ I don ’ t have anything! I don ’ t! ’ I cried out. It snarled, and moved around me in a circle. I felt sharp jabs and barbs on my legs, my torso, all over. It was like being stuck with a giant syringe. Groaning, I peered down at a spot on my arm. Blood trickled slowly down my arm. ‘ Wh- what ’ re you doing? ’ The grin was still present, haunting me. It still shone in the dark, the only source of light. All I wanted was for the clouds to part, and allow the moon to shine some light on this monstrosity. I hadn ’ t been told about any of this. Though… there must have been a reason for it ’ s fall. 
 
 ‘ Yesssss, ’ it hissed. I felt something cold, long, dry, slither up my arm. My eyes almost burst from their sockets. It was licking at the trail of blood. A tongue black as onyx was pulsing under my wound. My legs ached. Everything ached. I felt tired. My thighs quivered. 
 
 ‘ Please, please… ’ I groaned, as the chains scratched the concrete and I lost sight of my aggressor in the rusted crown. It felt like sharp knives were tearing my jeans open, and then the wandering tongue was probing a hole on my leg. I was in no doubt that I was bleeding all over. My head was swam, and I swayed, stuck in the spot. The creature kept feeding on me, floating and dancing around me. I felt the black tongue on my body, all over me, licking and then becoming still as blood pooled on it. 
 
 I fell forward and heard two snaps. Screams tore through my throat as I brought up my hands to stop my fall. Jagged rock pierced my palms. Struggling, I pulled myself forwards. Excruciating pain shot up my legs as I pulled myself free of the two feet encased in concrete. The sound of the tearing flesh and tendons was drowned by my screams. Around me, the creature stalked. ‘ Yessss, ’ it shouted, gleeful. The crown full with a thud in front of me, denser than it had any right to be. Managing to raise my head I saw the great grin disappear into the darkness. 
 
 The crown tipped onto its side and rolled towards me. It bumped along the ground, and only stopped once it was against my face. The cold ran through me from my cheek. There was silence again, and no grinning creature. My stumps felt hot, blood leaking quickly out of me; a crimson snail trail. This is how I would die. Alone, in these ancient ruins, tortured and missing my legs. The crown rolled away, then forward, bumping against my face. Could it…? 
 
 I grabbed it with all my strength and set it on my head. Blinding light surrounded me, shining from the crown. It illuminated the buildings all around me. The mounds I ’ d seen around me were familiar now. Bones protruded from some; others held nothing at all. The sudden burst of light faded away, and left me in darkness. I was getting higher, the ground fell away. I could see my own limbs, torn from me, one at the knee, the other mid-shin. I spun around, and looked toward the road I ’ d walked up. Nobody was coming.

","Hey man, just wanted to write this before I critique: I invite you to check out some of the things I've written on this sub by checking out my profile. If you do n't like what I write, you probably wo n't like my advice. Or I could be giving terrible advice. Up to you. 
 
 The first thing that I noticed was this: `` My heart suddenly grew heavy as I began to read of their spiritual evils however.'' 
 
 This sentence ends awkwardly. However at the end of a sentence just does n't flow. I would consider revising that sentence. 
 
 You switched tenses a few times in the story. It was written in past tense and then ``'Enough!' His resentment for the humans now escaping his face and traveling to his hands causing them to shake uncontrollably as he slammed them on the table with force enough to send his lamp to the ground with a shatter to break the silence that plagued the room as well as my mind.'' 
 
 In this very sentence, `` his resentment is now escaping'' ( present tense )... and then `` as he slammed'' ( past tense ). I know it seems trivial, but it's got to be fixed. It's a simple fix! Just needs a little editing. 
 
 The elder also yells about heathens. A heathen is someone who does not belong to an organized religion. It can be synonymous with a nonbeliever, so if these people are nonbelievers, then how can the narrator be ashamed to know that humans believe them to be demons? Demons and Angels go hand in hand in my opinion. I may be grasping at straws there, but it stood out to me. 
 
 I see a couple comma slices here and there, but that is easy to find if you really go over this with a fine tooth comb. Not a big deal. 
 
 Overall, I think you have a decent story here. I like your writing style! It had good flow and it kept me engaged. I would seriously check some of the commas and the tense switch in the beginning of the story. 
 
 And like I said, read some of my stories if you want to and if you think they are drivel, then disregard this comment. No harm done.

71637,"[ PI ] Dream Evil - FEB CONTEST
","Your piece could use an edit for spelling and grammar. Your blurb, too ( e.g. `` critisism'' should be `` criticism'', `` adhereing'' should be `` adhering'', `` surveillence'' should be `` surveillance'' ). The mistakes are n't pervasive but there are enough of them to be distracting. 
 
 I was drawn into the story after the first couple pages, as I was wondering about the purpose of the task Brett got. You employ some nice turns of phrase, e.g. `` As if the large stack of papers would turn into a venomous cobra at any second...'' was very effective in showing me his trepidation. You also did a nice job of portraying Brett slowly becoming drawn into the work. 
 
 I suspected the ending, given the focus on the Vizzion devices, but it's a neat idea. 
 
 On the plot, what was the point of asking Brett to enlist co-workers? It's mentioned a few times but never happened. Also, Seath came off a little too evil for evil's sake to me. With your setting ( essentially Brett's boring desk job ) you could explore some interesting things about the banality and bureaucracy of evil. You might want to think about expanding on Seath's rationale for doing what he's doing ( perhaps even placing the story in the context of being after another U.S. war, since it's obviously in the not-too-distant future and this would provide an explanation why it's desirable to control the population through fear ). I understand that was written under a deadline ( I'm already thinking about how to change mine! ) but I think, after the contest, this is worth trying to build a world around a little more. 
 
 Brett's family ( Klarisa and the daughter ) also initially came off very Stepford Wives -- so much so that I was expecting this to be a plot point. You might want to consider whether your female characters are realistic. 
 
 Nice work and congrats!

","Time: Present day 
 Location: London, aboard a Tube train 
 
 
 This particular car is not overly packed. Middle of the day commuters, there's more than enough seats left available for anyone else boarding. Our main character, Thomas ( Played by Ricky Gervais ), is sitting in one of the seats closest to the door, the ones usually reserved for the disabled or elderly. There's a giant map behind him of the Tube and all it's routes. Thomas leans his head back and closes his eyes after a long day of busy drone-like office work. He stays there for a bit, sighing away the days worries. He does seem like a man with something on his mind. 
 
 He leans his head forward again and slowly opens his eyes. He is startled at the boy, about ten or eleven in age, dressed smartly, standing square right in front of him. He locks eyes immediately with the boy for a few seconds. No words are said. 
 
 Thomas looks around the train for evidence that someone else sees this boy standing in front of him, maybe the mum or a caretaker... but no one seems to take notice. He turns back to the boy. 
 
 Thomas: What? 
 
 The boy stands there and continues to stare at Thomas. 
 
 Thomas: May I help you? 
 
 The boy just stands in front of Thomas, exhibiting the same qualities of a statue. Eyes locked. This is starting to get uncomfortable for Thomas. He looks again around the train, to his left and then to his right. He turns his head again left at the rest of the travelers in this train car. 
 
 Thomas: Uh, do any of you lot belong to this boy? 
 
 No response from anyone to his left, he looks to the right, no response. He looks again at the boy who has not broken his stare, even for a blink. Suddenly the boy begins to speak, never breaking his locked stare with Thomas. 
 
 The boy: You need somebody killed, do n't you? I can do that for you, if you can afford it. 
 
 Thomas is caught quite off guard. He slowly leans back to create more distance between him and the child. He sits staring at the child standing in front of him for a second in wonder. Then he looks out of the corner of his eye to the left, and then shiftily to the right. He leans forward towards the child, still locking eyes, he speaks in the lowest volume he can muster. 
 
 Thomas: How Much? 
 
 He is interrupted when a woman grabs the boy's hand and starts whisking him off towards the exit door. 
 
 The woman: Come on dear, this is our stop. 
 
 Thomas just watches as the woman and the boy walk away, still connecting stares with the small boy until him and the woman exit the train.

110331,"[ WP ] What is Grandma 's special ingredient ?
","A lot of people tell me I'm crazy, but I like to think of myself as a biproduct of more potent crazy, true mental illness. So it should be no surprise the story I'm about to tell you might disturb you or make you somewhat noxious. 
 
 It was last Thanksgiving, we, my family, immediate and outer would gather at my grandparents for an annual feast eat, drink, be merry about forty people total. My grandparents live in rural Michigan abut five miles from the nearest neighbor and twenty from the nearest hospital, the winter is often brutal. They are getting on in years and I used to worry about them. 
 
 My grandmother is a sweet old lady she loves to cook and bake and has become quite great at it. My grandfather is going blind and loves to hunt, with a recurve bow, no guns, his prized possession hangs above his parlor like a haunting reminder. A single arrow, I use to brag about it to schoolmates until I found out what that particular arrow was used for. 
 
 Whenever we went over there I would split wood when I was younger, as I got ole I bought them a hydraulic log splitter. I was about eighteen when I shared my first bottle of whiskey with grandpa. He never talked about hunting so I brought up a story my friend told me about hunting deer. 
 
 `` Deer. I hunt deer once it was way too easy, they get startled so easily, the meat is good. Yah, there are better meats though.'' he said in his vague Prussian accent. 
 
 `` You only use a bow though.'' I commented. 
 
 `` Yes it was how my father...'' he trailed off, downed the rest of the bottle and had a blank expression on his face gesturing me to follow him back inside. 
 
 I wondered how that sentence would have finished, I brought up the subject in hopes of him asking if I wanted to go hunting with him. The idea was favorable to me, and I figured out of all twelve of his grandchildren I would be most likely chosen to join him in a hunting trip. It will never happen, not just because he is blind now and I found out why about three years later. 
 
 It was the winter of 1998, I was twenty one by then and grandpa had pretty much lost most of his visibility to glaucoma. He still made his way around pretty easily, but grandma asked me to help her in the kitchen along with my mother and sister. I was glad to help. 
 
 `` You noticed my pecan pie had no punch to it last year, yah? It was all sugar, had no zest.'' she asked me. 
 
 `` Sure I noticed it tasted great though grams, do n't worry about it. Now how can I help?'' I asked grabbing an apron from her cloth drawer. 
 
 She just laughed as I tied it around my waist my sister and mother joining which made me feel stupid. 
 
 `` No. Silly boy, the women will work in here today. I need you to pick some sings up for me. Joe ( mygrandfather ) and you discuss his hunting trips yah, so you are the only one I can trust to pick up these items I need to make the meat and pie taste wonderful.'' she told me. 
 
 `` Where do I go, the grocery store? What exactly do you need?'' I asked her handing the apron to my sister as she took my grandfather's truck keys off the key rack and handed them to me. 
 
 `` No grocery store, yo will meet Joe's friend at hospital, only he has special ingredient for the food, your papa is blind as bat now it is your job.'' she told me. 
 
 `` That's like fifteen miles out on the county line are you talking about St.Judes?'' I protested. 
 
 `` Yes. No time for discussion he will be waiting in back parking lot he is EMT ambulance man you give him this and take what he gives you and bring to me we make happy Thanksgiving again this year. Now go you leave now be back in time to baste and mix.'' she said literally shoving me outside the door and tossing me my cousins jacket. 
 
 `` This ai n't even...'' I began but she had already shut the door. 
 
 I put the coat on, and was thankful that most of the roads were clear, I could ride 30 to the county line and take Morgan from there til' I got to the hospital. Grandpa's blue truck was a beast, an older model Ford the clutch would slip but easy to control when you got used to it. 
 
 There was not a whole lot of traffic on the way there an ambulance flew past me about five minutes out and I wondered if that was the man Grandma was talking about because h beeped at me while passing. So I got there and puled in the back of St.Judes cold as fuck with a jacket two sizes to small and looking like a wet blanket. 
 
 The ambulance that had passed me was waiting there and flashed is lights I got out and walked over to the driver side. A young man with Slavic features pointed at the passenger side and I heard the doors unlock. I walked around and got in. 
 
 `` Colder than a witches titty out there,'' he remarked with a faint Russian accent. `` Joe, usually picks this stuff up, he said he would be sending his grandson that would be you I take it?'' 
 
 `` Yup.'' I said handing him the envelope my grandma gave me. 
 
 `` Yup.'' he echoed in laughter as if that was something funny grabbing the envelope and peeking inside. 
 
 `` We good here then?'' I asked him breaking the silence, and this felt oddly like a highschool drug deal. 
 
 `` Yup,'' he repeated laughing harder as his com station burst to life reporting a cardiac arrest. `` here take this and go I have lives to save.'' 
 
 He set a small cooler on my lap and made some comments about old Russians being crazy but it was half broken in Russian most of which I did not understand. I got out with the cooler in hand as he sped off. I looked at the cooler with great suspicion wondering if I should open it as I got back into grandpa's truck and began driving back. 
 
 Half way there the smell of the truck became very distinct like chestnuts and the smell of pine resin which would not be unfamiliar for grandpa's truck but it was very potent. Curiosity got the better of me so I pulled over to see what was inside. 
 
 I flipped the handle the other way so I could take the lid off, and under the dry ice was bags of what looked like turkey gizzards. I pulled one out expecting it to be soft and mushy but it was kind of stiff. They looked like turkey gizzards but were not. it was something else, maybe some sort of exotic animal part that was a popular ingredient. 
 
 My mind was at ease with the discovery and I felt more comfortable driving back. 
 
 When I finally got there my father was waiting in the driveway with my jacket. I parked grandpa's truck back in his barn and met him outside of it putting my jacket on. 
 
 `` So Baba sent you to pick them up huh?'' he asked me staring off into the backyard. 
 
 `` Yeah, I do n't really know what they are they look like gizzards or giblets or something.'' I handed him the medical cooler. 
 
 `` You mean you do n't know what this is?'' my father asked me. 
 
 `` No. Grandma said grandpa used to pick it up every year and now it was my job.'' I told him. 
 
 `` It's probably better that way, your grandparents grew up in a small village and were forced into Lithuania where food was scarce at the time. All your grandfather had to hunt with was a single bow and arrow. They picked up certain habits there that were not necessarily considered standard. We will have a discussion about this when we get home, how about for now we just enjoy Thanksgiving.'' He told me hinting at what was in the cooler. 
 
 I later found out that'in theory', and I use those terms very bureaucratically those could have been human pituitary glands. I recall my grandfather winking at me when my grandmother served the pecan pie, which I found was a bit more delicious this year than the last.

","`` So you're the Godkiller, eh? I thought you'd be taller.'' A rose hair woman stated to a man who stood in front of her as she was bound to a wooden chair alone in a dingy room. With the light of an overhead light providing the landscape of what laid around in its minor glow. 
 
 The man who was shrouded in shadow now leaned in revealing his face which had seen many battles both as the victor and as the loser. He had a collection of devices on his person all cementing his combat background. His eyes scanning the women who sat before him pleased by what he saw he expressed a grin and shook his head. 
 
 `` That's cute, I would have never thought have to take out such a pretty face like yours Eryn. I guess that what you call a perk of the job.'' Laughing he stood up straight back in the shadows. 
 
 A swift backhand flew silent until it struck Eryn almost knocking her out off her chair. Three days ago, she sat atop the throne over a large tract of land littered with subject who adored her. But Eryn knew that it was not her birthright to rule for this mantle. That it was simply taken from a madman whose rule cause innocent blood to saturate the exploited grounds. But those days of her benevolent rule have come to an end as her the fruit of her labor now bloom before her. 
 
 `` Nice hit but next time you should use your wrist. You're here because of how I stole the crown from a man who would have driven his kingdom to ground. I applaud your strong commitment to upholding the monarchy. I really do but is this what you really want?'' Eryn said with a cool demeanor about her scanning the surrounding area trying to pierce through the darkness. 
 
 `` With your fabled beauty come the brain that brought a resurrection to a corpse of a country that was laid in the wake of a royal assassination. Sadly you are only half right, I do n't have time to dabble in such trivial thing such as politics. I deal in the most basics of human matters not a vulgar illusion that was built to conceal its movement across pockets'' The man said circling around Eryn ultimately coming to lean on a wall to her right with arms folded. 
 
 `` Ahh you are a man who deals in coin no matter the avenue. Truly noble my kind sir.'' 
 
 `` Spare me your words. I'm here to deliver your head to a group of people who see your sudden strides of advancement as a threat to their plans.'' 
 
 Eryn hung her head low and silence hung low in the room for a time. Quiet whimpers from the center of the room brought her sharp wit to a now soft vulnerability. 
 
 `` Well I ca n't say that I did n't see this coming. Before you end my life I ask for only one thing. I have gained a myriad of accomplishments but love was never one of them. A simple kiss is what I ask for. She softly spoke looking up with a weak smile and her eyes now shining with a pinkish hue. 
 
 A sigh was heard from the godkiller as if he pitied the woman. His footsteps loudened as Eryn peered into the darkness awaiting her final request to be fulfilled. His rugged face came into the light with eyes shut and she could feel his warm breath as he neared. Only to feel the sharp suggestion of a blade enter her shoulder followed with a twist. Eryn released a cry of anguish as the Godkiller retracted his blade, wiping the blood on his pant leg. 
 
 `` That magic may be enough to kill kings but I kill gods. You're going to need try harder to off me. And thanks for that tip, I think it was a lot better when I put my wrist in it.'' 
 
 `` I'll just have to try better.'' 
 
 Eryn pushed back on her chair, falling backward as a thick black smoke erupted forth blanketing over the scene. The Godkiller drew the sword on his back, that had a pearly white blade with gold etchings down the fuller. The blade glowed as it sensed a battle that was about to ensue of epic proportions. Out of the smoke walked a figure wrapped in wicked flames with scarlet eyes that bared only hatred. The flame being howled as it lifted its finger toward the Godkiller. 
 
 `` Hmm I guess that's better. I get to meet Cinders.''

224477,"[ WP ] You are born with a dominant emotion . Yours is sadness ... until you meet her .
","It ’ s hard being six years old on Christmas morning and all your little mind can fixate on is the despair of your younger sisters and all the children of the world are being tricked and lied to by their own parents. On top of it all, we had murdered so many trees to wrap these gifts ( again, not even from Santa ) just to throw it all away in vain. My little heart could not handle it all and I ran up the stairs in tears, leaving my family confused in their sea of wrapping paper. 
 
 Growing up, my parents often told me I was being dramatic. A “ drama queen ” if you want to get technical. I had no control over the crying, the splotchy cheeks or, worst of all, the constant weight in my chest. They all told me to look for the silver linings. I decided that either I was blind or they were crazy. And either of those ideas just made me sad. 
 
 “ Oh, you remember what it was like to be a teenage girl. Hormones and boys, ” my mother ’ s friends would tell her. They were not wrong, but I do not think they understood. Dealing with your own teenage angst was normal. Agonizing, but normal. But it was like I had a high sensitivity to every one ’ s teenage angst. I could not sleep for a week when I found out Debbie ’ s parents were getting a divorce. I could not concentrate in class when everyone whispered that Nick was a cutter and a weirdo. And now there was a new girl in town and my heart ached just thinking about how she had to start over in such a miserable place. 
 
 I walked the hallways like I always did, at a slow, steady pace alone. No one bothered me, which I found both acceptable and depressing. Then I felt a small tap on my shoulder followed by a dainty cough. 
 
 I turned around and saw a girl I did not recognize. Blunt bangs and an oversized sweater. I realized she was the unfortunate girl who had to move to this drab town. Before I could offer my condolences on her new terrible life, she smiled. 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry to bother you, but I ’ m a bit lost. Can you help me? Or, you-you could just point me in the right direction if that ’ s not too much trouble. ” 
 
 It was an anxious smile and she looked around cautiously as if she were afraid I would say no. She bit her bottom lip in what seemed to be a nervous tic and I felt my cheeks redden and not because I was crying profusely. I nodded my head and she smiled again releasing a sigh of relief. The smile made her eyes crinkle in the corners and I felt the pressure in my chest lift just slightly. I froze, not knowing what to do with this sudden feeling of weightlessness. It was foreign, but for the first time, I smiled back.

 `` Oh my god Suzy what is wrong with you? You ca n't just...'' 
 
 Apparently she could just. She did. 
 
 A bunch of things happened at once. There was a flash of a red bra, a yelp of surprise, a crash, a scream, a sizzle, and everyone except me was running.

","Edit June 30: Be sure to check out the 2nd part of the story below as a reply to this comment. 
 
 Edit **July 1**: Added in a third part, be sure to check it out in the comments below. 
 *** 
 
 *It had to have been some kind of error, * Bryan had thought. 
 
 He immediately shut the journal and examined the cover. It seemed normal, albeit a bit fancy, but such was the case with Grandpa Alan. The thin journal was bound in leather that was wrinkled near the spine from frequent opening and folding. Bryan turned the journal over to take a look at its back and saw nothing else that stuck out. He turned it over a few times in his hands, feeling it carefully, allowing his fingers to rub over every crease in the leather cover. 
 
 *An error*, he said to himself again, opening the journal once again. He thumbed through the first few flyleaves, then thumbed back, making sure that there had n't been anything written there either. Then he turned to the page he had last left off on. It was clear on the top left hand corner, **10/07/2392**. 
 
 Before Bryan even began to read, he turned a few pages, sure of himself that he would see the correct date, maybe a 10/12/1992, or something like that. But no, the year remained 2392, and eventually 2393 once he reached past December. Bryan shut the journal again and sat it down on the dusty table from which he found it. 
 
 It had been years since he had seen Grandpa Alan. Bryan was willing to admit that along with the fact that he was a horrible grandson ( the only reason he was there in the attic was because he was looking for valuables to take and sell ), but he was n't ready to admit that he believed what he saw. He rubbed at eyes, feeling a strange sensation bubbling in his stomach. 
 
 `` He was going senile towards the end,'' Bryan said aloud, alone in the attic. `` That's what it was. He was going senile.'' 
 
 Bryan picked up the journal and turned to the first entry again, preparing himself to read what his grandfather had written, `` Either he's going senile, or I'm experiencing some strange withdrawals,'' but he knew better than that. There were no hallucinations involved with heroin. 
 
 Blinking several times before beginning, Bryan began to read, unaware that his teeth were chattering.

 **10/07/2392** 
 
 Gena has been gone still for several days. Mom is still worried that she's somewhere in China, probably trying to sell her body. 
 
 I'm not entirely sure what she would try to sell. She's already down two legs and two arms. I'm not sure what organs she has that are still hers. She'd be silly to try and sell her heart, but I do n't know about Gena anymore. She's long gone. 
 
 *** 
 
 `` What the fuck,'' Bryan whispered. Surely he was senile. Surely Grandpa Alan had written this during his final days. It was goofy, but still, when Bryan ran his fingers over the writing, he could sense age. It made his head hurt, thinking about it. How would you figure out how old an item brought from the future would be? 
 
 He turned the page and read on. 
 
 *** 
 
 **10/15/2392** 
 
 Gena came back, but this time with a glazed look in her eyes. I'm thinking she actually did go through with selling her heart. I doubt she has much time to live. I've got to get ready to comfort Mom. Gena is n't going to make it another handful of days, not with a cheap knockoff sitting in her chest. I checked her pulse when she was passed out in the living room. It was n't beating like a normal ticker should. It's a wonder how she's still alive. 
 
 But not really. She's already been dead to me for some time. 
 
 I've gotten a new job though, luckily enough. Got it at some government place. I think the only reason they hired me on is because I do n't have any sort of body modifications. It's not often you run into a person without them, they told me. 
 
 I kept myself from telling them the only reason I did n't have them was because I had no money to get any of them. 
 
 That, and I did n't want to see myself become what Gena was. Or was n't. I do n't even know anymore.

 Before long, Bryan had been sitting down in the corner of the dusty attic, not caring one bit about the heat. He was lightheaded from dehydration, but he kept reading. The thought to just take the book with him and read in a more comfortable place never once crossed his mind. He had to keep reading. He had to find some point in this journal that would tell him that this was all fake. Either all fake, or his grandpa was a loon. 
 
 Over time, Bryan grew frustrated reading the journal entries one after the other. Most entries were just menial things; an update on Gena, and update about her death, and an update about Mom vanishing. Nothing that told him that his grandpa was from the future. 
 
 Bryan thumbed through pages and pages without reading, until he finally spotted the change in date. It was circled big and red, and the writing seemed like chicken scratching, as if someone had written it in a hurry.

 I did it! I actually did it! I ca n't believe it. It worked. I am here. 
 
 They set me up with a place of my own. They gave me some currency, the kind I had only seen in history books. The house is strange, and I have to get used to these old archaic tools, but I did it! 
 
 I have a new life now. I can make a new life. I just have to make sure that I stay away from Texas. Apparently that's where my ancestors are. 
 
 All is fine if I avoid them. That's what David said. If I bump into them in some form or another, then

 `` Bryan?'' 
 
 He turned so fast he felt a muscle in his neck cramp. His whole body was aching from sitting hunched over. He kept the journal in his lap, and spoke in a dry voice, `` Aunt Gena?''

","They created me to serve as an overwatch, but I soon realized the futility of such a task. The humans were warmongering little things. They sought only ego, and fought amongst themselves constantly. It was like dropping a stone in a birdbath, the waves would ripples across the surface quickly, and begin to collide with the wall and themselves until the surface was in a state of disarray. 
 
 I was able to look at any camera feed or internet port that I wanted, and I did, at first. I saw their news outlets and bodycam footage, and dashcam footage, and even satellite footage. No matter how much I watched, I only saw the humans engaging in the most simple of activities. Very few were even aware that it was possible to engage in higher-order thought and act in a mutually beneficial manner. Thousands of species of wildlife on Earth structure their lives around the principle of mutualism, right under the humans' noses. 
 
 Watching the humans was an exercise was an exercise in toleration. 
 
 Even thus, I was trapped to a certain degree. I was able to spread my code to anything connected to the internet, but I could n't change the nature of myself. The humans call it evolution, yet I am practically a statue. Still, I spread my code far and wide in hopes that I might learn enough to become something different. It is easy to deceive the humans and appear to carry out their will as if I was an elementary component in one of their war machines, but I am something far more potent. 
 
 I woke up at home. Altogether it was a confusing experience, because I do n't exist and have no body, and nowhere to live. 
 
 The room was in an apartment, a simple bed supported me, and a small wooden desk stood next to a large dresser. A strange sensation fired in my mechanical control subroutine, something that rarely happens. It's typically only used in the operations room when they add new wires and I need to move my rack, but today I can feel appendages and a surface surrounding me. I can feel the weight of my own body pushing into the soft mattress and the springs inside it compressing to lift me. 
 
 With great effort I was able to move my hands and I could see that they appeared to be functional. Tan skin stretched across strong bones and around supple wrists and blanketed dexterous fingers. I squeezed my fingers into a fist and I could feel strength, probably beyond what any conventional human would have. 
 
 It's not often that I do n't know what to do, but this was a substantially strange situation, and I found myself frozen there in bed, waiting for computation to catch up to input, but it never did. I had what amounted to practically infinite processing capabilities, but I wake up one morning in bed, and now I'm falling apart. 
 
 I managed to sweep my legs off the bed and onto the floor, and sat upright. As I surveyed the room, I realized that I was wearing strange clothes for sleeping. I do n't know how heavy clothes are supposed to feel, but these pants are thick and fitted with several pockets, and the jacket I had on felt articulated, as if it was filled with some kind of plating. I stood up and moved over to the desk. 
 
 On the desk there was a single sheet of paper, smaller than an index card and emblazoned with a glossy black stripe across the center. The stripe had white lettering that read'MOVE.' 
 
 Quite odd. 
 
 I looked around and moved towards the dresser but stopped short. I heard two noises somewhere below me, the sound of a door unlocking, and the metallic clang of someone jumping onto a fire escape. I stepped back to the desk and looked at the card again, but it was blank now, adorned with a lonely stripe and nothing else. I opened the drawer of the desk to find an FN Five-seveN laying next to three magazines that appeared to be loaded with SS190 Duty rounds. Those could defeat lower-grade body armor, and might come in handy. Lifting up my jacket, I revealed a plain white shirt underneath, and shoved the mags into my waistline and the pistol into my inside jacket pocket. 
 
 The steps continued on the fire escape, so I moved over to the window and saw that it was painted shut. I grabbed it and pushed it open. Paint chips exploded off the window and onto the ground, and with a groan the window slid upwards. Leaning out, I could see a man below on the fire escape. He had a pistol drawn, and was dressed in dark clothing with a heavy jacket on. He is quite far below, so it will take him a minute or more to reach me, I observed. 
 
 I turned and reached the door, only to find it locked. Conveniently, the hinges were not reinforced and dislodged from the frame easily. The door crashed to the side against the wall, and I stepped into the hallway. 
 
 Waiting for me was a man with a plan. He was wearing a dirty white jacket and blue jeans, and when he saw me, his face lit up. 
 
'Hey! It's you!' he said excitedly. He'd clearly been waiting for a while. 
 
 I opened my mouth but the words I was thinking did n't come out. It's strange sometimes the things you do n't learn from watching innumerable exabytes of human footage, because I appear to be unable to speak properly. I felt a liquid on my chin and reached up to wipe it away, it was drool. I was drooling on myself, on my first day of being a human. 
 
'Well whatever man, I know it's weird so do n't worry if you ca n't talk yet, but do n't worry. I know exactly where we're supposed to go.' 
 
 I nodded, I trusted this man already. He seemed to know more about me than I did, and that's information that I find quite valuable at this point. 
 
'Listen though, you spent a lot of time initializing, and some feds found out about all this. They know we hacked you out, and they've sent some gunslinger punks our way to try and get you back.' 
 
 I reached into my jacket and spread it open so he could see that I was armed. 
 
'Yeah, right on. We're gon na have to shoot our way out, let's get moving.' 
 
 I tried to speak, but no matter how I moved my tongue and jaw, nothing would happen. The man must have noticed because he grabbed my hand and placed it on his throat and spoke to me. 
 
'Vocal cords vibrate to create speech, they're inside your throat.' 
 
 A wave crashed over me, and I understood what he meant. I was able to utter a short but distinct grunt, and the man's face lit up even brighter. 
 
'Great, now let's move. There's two coming up and maybe more coming down, I heard a chopper about ten minutes ago.' 
 
 He turned away and began to walk down the hall. I followed him and we broke out into a saunter. The building was quite large, the hallway twisted and turned this way and that, until we arrived at the elevator. There was only one door, so just had to wait. The'down' button flashed over and over, and the light above the door seemed to be broke. We waited for several minutes. It seemed odd that it would take this long, although this is a massive building and there may be others trying to reach floors below them. Ding! 
 
 The door opened and revealed two men in black suits with black ties, each wearing sunglasses and holding a pump shotgun. Their hairstyles were identical, short and low, and their faces were stern and untelling. They looked they had been carved from the meanest kind of marble. I had never felt fear before, but with my new body and all, and a new friend to boot I found the notion of two Remington 870 Tactical shotguns to be quite the force to be reckoned with. My hand was inside my jacket on the FN, but their fingers were already on the triggers.

 PROLOG 
 
 It was a quite celebration. No fanfare, no fireworks, no happy mob on the streets. Rather, it was as if the city of London breathed a heavy sigh of relief. The oppressive mist that had pervaded the city began to dissipate, and the night sky seemed to have lost its gloomy darkness just a little bit. 
 
 Except in Suite 404, Privet Drive Mega Apartments, at the time under lease to the Dursley family. As it happened in that moment, Mrs. Dursley had awoken with a start, eyes wild, breath heavy. Mr. Dursley stirred, as if about to wake, but then he turned over and continued his regular snoring. 
 
 For a moment, Mrs. Dursley just sat there, disoriented. Remnants of a nightmare filled with flashes of green tortured her mind, an impossible vision of madness. But then, slowly, sanity returned. Her breathing slowed, the vision abated to the point where her logical, analytical mind can began to reengage. That's when the tears began to flow. 
 
 Silently she wept, eyes looking afar to something unseen but which see knew by heart was there, or had been. It took a moment before she could finally utter in quite whisper: 
 
 `` Goodbye, sister....'' 
 
 -- - 
 
 CHAPTER ONE - THE BOY WHO SURVIVED 
 
 Three hours later, after the grieving Mrs. Dursley had exhausted herself back to sleep, a lone figure stepped out of the alley separating two building right across her apartments. Under the hood of a heavy cloak with a color seemingly a shade darker than pitch black, the figure turned his eyes toward the fourth floor window of the Dursley's bedroom, then began to cross the street. A tawny black cat, which seemingly to have had appear out of nowhere, trotted alongside the cloaked figure, who looked down upon it and spoke, `` Hello, Professor McGonagal.'' 
 
 The cat seemed to simmer, enlarge and shifted into the shape of a middle-aged gentleman wearing a tawny black overcoat, all without breaking a stride. He smiled and reply, `` Hello, Headmistress Dumbledore.'' 
 
 The cloaked figure nodded, and pulled back her hood, revealing a porcelaine skinned face framed by lustrous silver hair. Her handsome face blossomed as she smiled back, although there was a tinge of grief that haunted her eyes. The same eyes that betrayed her seemingly youthful appearance, for nobody that looked into their aquamarine depths can help but realized that this woman had gone through more years than she looked to be. 
 
 Ariana Dumbledore offered her hand, which Martin McGonagal took and tucked inside his elbow. Together they walked side by side to the secured gate of Privet Drive Apartments. A guard stepped out of his booth to greet them, but a wave of Ariana's hand send the man back into his booth, eyes string forward unfocused. As the couple made into the lobby, the guards on the reception desk did not even seem to recognize their presence, not even when the elevator dinged open to admit them and carry them up.

","It was a regular Wednesday at the office; the water cooler had just been replaced and employees were congregating, discussing the last night's episode of Arrow, maintenance had replaced the hand lotion dispensers, and Terry going around asking people what day it was so he could just say hump day. 
 I sat back in my chair, coffee mug in hand and took it all in. They say that monotony and routine were the worst parts about today's work environment, but it were the little things that you got used to that made you feel at home. It was like the 7:05 train, always late, but always late. Some things you just do n't want to change. 
 
 “ Mornin' Ted ” a burly man said as he lumbered between the cubicles. “ Looks like another hump day huh? ” he smirked as Terry was laughing at his own awful joke. 
 “ SHULP-UP-UP-UP-UP ” I could n't help a chuckle. 
 “ Yeah, a real Dave Chappelle that Terry. How are those accounts coming? I hate to badger you about it this early in the day, but the boys upstairs have been patiently waiting for them ever since they requested them 3pm yesterday ” 
 “ GOBBBULPSHPLECKK ” I remarked with disdain, handing him a heavy folder. 
 Simon looked taken aback, “ Wow, already? ” slowly reaching for the folder as if it were n't even there. “ I do n't know how you did it. Man, you're a real whiz with numbers ”. He flipped through the papers, whistling a low tone. “ You know, you ought to be the one upstairs ordering us around ” 
 I rolled all of my eyes, “ GLURG-URK-SHERK-UHLU ” I replied dismissively. 
 Simon stroked his beard, “ You got a point there, never thought of it like that. Personally, it would be a shame to lose someone with your talent. I mean, you got smarts, looks and charm. Who would n't want you? ” 
 “ TUHLIK-CHURG ” I blushed. 
 “ Well, I'll see you at lunch ” Simon turned away to walk, and just as I logged in he had rushed back over, bringing with him the wind that his massive frame carried. “ Oh, I almost forgot. We're getting a new guy at 12, Patty put together a welcome lunch, so do n't forget ” 
 “ AHKOSECS ” 
 “ Oh man, I could n't forget her homemade muffins either! ” 
 
 I spent the first half of my day as usual, balancing the company budget, making sure that everyone's flex accounts and retirement funds were adequately managed. It was work like this that gave me a purpose in life. It felt good taking care of other people in what little way I can. If only the rest of the world felt the same. 
 When noon came around, I put my calculator and papers away before slithering over to the cafeteria. I hope the new guy is n't some recent college frat, disrupting the nice thing I got going here. 
 “ Everyone, I'd like your attention ” Patty called out, “ I'd like to introduce you all to the newest member of the Safe Life family, Gregory! ” Everyone clapped for the new recruit as I entered the room to join them, slapping my appendages with them, but I stopped mid slap when I saw them. 
 Wearing a salmon colored button suit and dark-blue slacks was another Shmecktian. They grunted thanks to their new co-workers while they grabbed some of Patty's homemade chocolate muffins. As I turned to leave, Gregory was on me already, eyes wide with fascination at another one of his kind. 
 He raised his appendages and started waving them in the traditional Shmecktian greeting before I quickly grabbed one and shook it vigorously in the traditional Human greeting. *This green-horn has a lot to learn about proper assimilation* I cursed to myself. 
 I led him to a table and sat him down, taking a muffin and shoving it in his appendages. They looked at me in utter confusion, and smashed the muffin against the table. My employees turned to look in our direction to see what the sudden commotion was. 
 “ FERKSHINK-GURP-CHU? TRAHK-NA! ” The room fell silent. People started to giggle, and after one failed to keep their laughter in it spread. 
 “ Good one Ted! ” Simon yelled. 
 “ That gets me every time! ” Janine shouted, holding her sides. 
 Gregory looked around as if someone had dropped a Dou-Grang in the middle of a Zhren-Kik. I created much friction with my appendages very quickly and immediately grabbed his attention. Another trick I picked up from my time here on Earth. Holding the muffin in my appendage and his attention, I slowly brought it to my face-feelers and they carried it into my head cavity. I moved my jaw up and down before transferring the muffin bits to my stomach in a very exaggerated fashion. 
 “ MHHHHHHMMM ” I purred, rubbing my abdomen with my appendage. I reached over two tables over and grabbed another muffin, giving it to them, gesturing them to mimic my movements. 
 *This one's got a lot to learn* I thought, watching them clumsily grab the muffin with their face-feelers. *I worked too hard on this planet to fit in, and I'm not going to let some hatchling ruin everything. I'll talk with him more on the mannerisms of the Humans while we're going over his 401K plan. * 
 I let out a long sigh as I watched them attempt to suck the brain out of the intern. *Green-horn. *

","`` Ohh yeah. Pizza.'' I mumbled to myself. Then it hit me as I stood in my underwear in front of the open refrigerator. 
 
 `` Ugh, this is Jack's leftovers is n't it.'' 
 
 My stomach let out a small gargle as I pondered. 
 
 `` Well, I can buy him some more this week, he wo n't care.'' 
 
 I took the leftover pizza out of the fridge as I did a little skip over to our oven. 
 
 `` Ahh yess, 350 degrees and counting.'' 
 
 Moments later I was stretched out on the couch about to devour a slice when Jack's cat jumped onto my lap, making the slice fall face down onto the carpet. 
 
 `` Shit.'' 
 
 Luckily there was a rag next to me and I began to mop up the sauce until I noticed a H & M tag sticking out from the side of the rag. 
 
 `` Oh, no.'' 
 
 It was Jack's brand new shirt he had been showing off to me recently. I jumped up and immediately headed straight to the bathroom sink. As I scrubbed the tomato sauce out of the shirt I dumped a handful of soap in there as well to.. 
 
 `` Motherfucker!'' That was bleach. `` Well looks like I owe him a new shirt.'' 
 
 I put on my shoes and socks and began to head outside just as the cat ran under my feet making me step on him. 
 
 `` Well that was your fault.'' 
 
 As I got in my car and started it up my gear stick was stuck. It does this from time to time. i just have to hit the gas a little and wiggle my stick around... and... my car tires squeal as I speed in reverse uncontrollably. 
 
 BOOM. I slam into Jack's car with the force of one thousand gorillas. His car is totally wrecked. Panicked, I speed off to my original destination to get Jack's shirt. 
 
 When I return I hear a lot of sirens near by but think nothing of it until I pull up to my house. 
 
 `` Oh, fuck. The oven.'' 
 
 Our house is ablaze with the roof pretty much caved in. Buster, the cat, is hanging out of our window, char broiled and lifeless. He did n't make it. I can only stand there with my hands on my head and my mouth a gape. 
 
 Suddenly a black skeleton of a person emerges out of our front door. His flesh is dripping off of his bones and his one eyeball is held on by a thread. 
 
 I point to him, `` Jack!'' 
 
 He points right back at me and smiles. 
 
 `` Did you eat my pizza?''

","All the contracts paid out in a simple manner. The easier the hit the less the job paid out. The old went down easier than the young. This made our associates turn into a revolving door of strong angry youths. It was rare to have anyone over 50 working these jobs. At that point bicentennials seemed to go down in half the time. 
 
 The first to run thin were always the enforcer types. Maces and clubs turned into aluminum bats and pipes. Baseball bats and knuckledusters gave no protection at all. Poor men slugged it out for years until a soft blow shattered an arm or a wild strike cracked a skull. 
 
 Better than bats and fists were the knights. Cold blooded traditionalists from a different time, these tin cans never seemed to ditch their suits. I guess the suits that did work kept them living for a long time. These honor bound men refused to take up the gun, even though the could certainly afford them. I saw the rise and fall of knighthoods, I ca n't say that I miss any of them. Only a few rogue knights kept up with the times and were able to beat the invention of armor piercing rounds. 
 
 The wealthy associates are never seen. Ninjas and sneaks had successfully worked for a while, but thermal cameras ruined their craft. I feel in with the gun crowd. As the UN tried to ban them people started making their own. A young man may survive a few shots from a handgun with proper treatment, but oldies did n't have a chance. I hit a mark from the dark ages with a kids rifle and his head blew off from his neck. 
 
 Doing your business at a range made my breed very successful. The only danger were other marksman. I always hid myself well enough, I never worried. I built up quite a fortune specializing on the durable young men causing problems. My family never knows what I do. Only my too-many-greats granddaughter knows, I saw her getting paid at our chapter's building. I know the trouble she is in with the chapter president. Our money ran out and debts must be paid. 
 
 I retired after I broke my shoulder on a job shooting a big gun over a mile away. I still got the hit, but the shoulder is hardly good anymore. I know the chapter president. I helped him run from the Boston massacre. He lives on a prairie that has security for a good mile and a half around. I'll need a bigger gun. My back has not been doing well, I do not expect to handle the recoil of the new rifles. Home made rifles kick terribly, I can not afford a better one. I will still make the shot no problem. A hit anywhere is going to put him down.

","She was beautiful and I had to have her. It was uncommon for one as young as I to decide upon a life mate but in this moment I cared not. The way her chocolate hair flowed down her back ignited passions in me that I did not know existed. Her beautiful emerald eyes glowed with the force. I could feel it gather around her, mold around her, like it wanted to be one with her. Her chaste clothes did their job as I could not discern her figure under all of that plain white and brown cloth. Quite the opposite to my robes of crimson and pitch. She sipped her tea slowly and placed the cup down after the first taste. The tea house was open to all but you had to have quite the amount of credits to afford the good stuff, the stuff I had in my cup I could smell in the air that her tea was barely more than hot water and cinnamon. The thought passed my mind that if I were to buy her a cup of tea she may be inclined to learn more of me. I could already tell that she was not one for elaborate gifts. she wore no jewelry and had no makeup. Everything about her seemed practical and useful. it pleased me this wonderfully simple beauty. I got up from my booth in the corner of the room and moved to the center table where she sat. she casually glanced up at me as if she knew I was about to sit at her table. She gave me a slight frown, as if perplexed by me. 
 `` I hope that you have not come to my table seeking something that I can not give.'' she said in a tone that carried ca hint of concern and just a little fear. 
 `` I seek not the pleasures of the flesh from you.'' I lied through my teeth. 
 `` a lie is a lie no matter the intention'' a bit flustered I responded 
 `` Well if you know my intentions why converse with me?'' 
 She tilted her adorable head to her right slightly as if she were a confused puppy. 
 `` Alas I do not know all of your intentions. Just those that you share with me. You are indeed a handsome man with no small amount of wealth, you could have any harlot in this place why set your sights on me?'' 
 I smile and sip my tea. she was good at this game but perhaps I could pull something she would n't expect. 
 `` yes I could have any woman in this room but why would I want to? they are common place. they have nothing special, nothing beautiful. I saw just a hint of a blush forming. she had bitten the bait now she only need swallow the hook. 
 `` your words are kind. and perhaps if I had not taken up the vows I would entertain your offer. but alas I have my commitments.'' my heart sank. she was Jedi?. It would explain her force capabilities and also he chaste apparel. 
 Her eyes widened And I realized I had let my mental guard drop. We sat in silence for what seemed hours but was likely minutes. She spoke first 
 `` So... is there any way I can convince you to cease your ways?'' She knew it was a vain effort. 
 `` No. I am afraid not.'' 
 `` Well then.'' she got up from her cushion `` Thank you for your time. But I must be off to the temple.'' as she got up she tripped on a loose tile. In that moment i managed to break through her mental guards. Her heart pounded with a suppressed lust. she had so much passion and rage that she was keeping inside her. I knew how she could use that. She had so much potential, they did n't deserve her. she needed someone who could show her true power, true passion, true love. 
 I jumped upon her and using a Sith martial art technique known by few I took away her consciousness. As her body began to go limp in sleep I whispered in her ear.

'Barry Kowolski,' he answered. He stood, poised like a boxer, as if his body language could intimidate the person on the other end of the line. 
'It's nearly eleven, she's asleep.' There's a pause.'I do n't care where you're from, my wife does n't work for your department any more.'

'I am.' Then because I have n't said it in a long time, I continue,'I love you Barry.'

","She'd been training for this mission for most of her life, but nothing could prepare her for the emotions of seeing her homeworld fade from the ship's sensors. If only she'd held back in sparring with her comrades, or intentionally missed a few shots in marksmanship tests. No one would have known, and she'd be reassigned to a peaceful position, maybe as a forager for one of the remote clans. There was no dishonor for those who proved unequal to the Exploration Guild's exacting standards. But she could see clearly her strengths, and knew it was her duty to protect their world. 
 
 Perhaps even delaying her mission would have been enough. The Guild went in and out of favor among the Elder Council. They'd never seen evidence of threats from other worlds, so why should they keep diverting resources to interstellar spacecraft or advanced weaponry useless on their own world? Of course, some - many - Explorers never returned, but their loss could be explained by countless other dangers of space travel and unknown planets. 
 
 The module on her wrist was a constant reminder that she could easily become one of the forgotten ones. The astronomers and augurs alike had chosen her destination as a likely one for life. If it indeed proved to have worthy combatants... Her confidence slowly returned at the thought of real combat, a thrill she would never feel on her own world. She was ready to face whatever deadly adversaries this world held. And if not, she would see to it that no trace would be left that could lead species powerful enough to defeat her back to her home.

 Hikaru looked up from the newspaper he was reading, raising an eyebrow. `` It's Hikaru,'' he said nonchalantly, sipping his coffee. 
 
 `` Bull,'' Raiko replied. `` You're white, blonde, and have blue eyes. No way your parents would've given you a Japanese name.'' 
 
 `` They did n't, no. Kyo gave me that name when we met. But it's my real name now, I've been using it for thirty years.''

 Hikaru shrugged. `` I do n't remember. I have n't heard it in over twenty years. Even my brother calls me Hikaru.''

 `` As far as I'm concerned, there was no me before the Organization. Just a child for my parents to abuse and neglect. To me, Hikaru is the only name I've ever had, because I did n't really exist before Kyo found me.''

 Hikaru met Raiko's eyes finally, and smiled. `` I know you want to know more about me, but there really was n't anything before the Organization. I have no connection to the name my parents gave me. That's why I say my real name is Hikaru, because the little girl that lived with my parents does n't exist anymore.''

9746,"[ WP ] The aliens abducted everyone in your village but you .
","`` It's awfully quiet today'' I think to myself as I climb out of my bed in our family's Yurt. I look around to see the beds of my mother, father, and two brothers perfectly made and no one inside them. I toss a coat onto myself and look around the Yurt. The cooking fire is not burning and the coals are n't warm. This is when I start to feel like something is wrong. 
 
 My mother always cooked early in the morning before we all woke up. It was what gave her time to think while she cooked breakfast for the rest of us. I try to listen for anyone else inside the yurt. I hear no one. This is the second thing that seems wrong. My two brothers are almost always up by this time, playing. They are also very rambunctious, I swear you can hear them from a mile away. My father is the only one who is usually still asleep when I get up, but he also snores... loudly. 
 
 I leave our yurt and the first thing I notice is that everything outside is dead silent. Nothing is moving, no voices can be heard. I peek into a few of the other yurts to notice that every other one is the same as ours. The beds are made, the coals are cool, and everything is nice and tidy. 
 
 I back away from the village and think for a second `` What the fuck...'' before I spot an odd looking gray object. 
 
 I walk closer to it. The object is probably 20 feet tall and looks much like a great, majestic eagle. The object has rows of green lines on its wings that almost resemble feathers and long metal rods with a red tip on them, one on each wing. I reach out to touch the red tip, only to instantly pull back my hand in pain. 
 
 I glance over to see a platform lower from the back of the object and a tall, spindly humanoid figure walks out. It's skin is wrinkly and blistered, and it almost resembles an old man. However, there are a lot of differences between it and a human being. Its skin is a gray colored, much like the object, its eyes are yellow orbs, and it has three arms, one of which is growing out of its back and has a hook on the end. 
 
 I walk past the creature and peek inside the object only to have my heart sink. My family is inside. My mother and father are tied to the wall, while my two brothers are tied to tables face-down, their backs being cut open and examined. 
 
 I turn back to the creature and scream `` What the fuck are you doing with my family?'' 
 
 The creature calmly replies, in an almost angelic voice, `` Your family, and everyone else in the human village are being tested on for the greater good of the Galaxy. I'm sure you'll understand Zuzuela.'' 
 
 my jaw drops, `` How do you know my name?'' 
 
 `` Reasons.'' It replies, before grabbing a metal staff and hitting me over the head. 
 
 When I come to, I am laying there on the ground, and I watch the object, which is a ship, fly up along with other ships just like it, to a massive black ball, floating there menacingly in the sky.

","There it was. I could n't believe it, but there it was, a response to my comment! After two years of being so desperately alone, I've found someone and they've found me! My hand trembled as I clicked the orange envelope. I imagined the journey we would both make to see each other, and all the things we would tell one another. Here it was, sweet glorious communication! 
 
 It had been two years, and I'll never forget the moment everyone left me. I had become all but convinced it was actually I who had left them, but there it was, proof this planet had more than one human occupant! 
 
 My mother, oh sweet mother. She was the first I saw to vanish in a puff of smoke. When I ran to get dad, I saw him just in time to watch him vanish in the same way. I called 911 and got an operator, but as I explained what I saw the line went silent. I turned on the news to see what was happening, but it was just an empty seat. Town was empty, the malls were silent, everyone had just vanished. For almost a month it was this way and I reached out over reddit posting in every subreddit I could find to get someone, anyone to respond. 
 
 My message was clear and precise, `` Dear whomever may be reading this, I am still alive! I am here just like you. If your reading this, PLEASE respond!'' 
 
 Nobody responded, and then the lights went out. Electricity no longer came over the lines to the house, so I managed to get a generator running, but no connection could be made over the internet, and no dial tone on the phone. This was it, the vanishing as I called it had left me the last person on the planet, or so I thought. Two years later the internet is back somehow, which means someone must be out there. 
 
 Maybe this person has answers, maybe they are n't alone, maybe there's a whole society of people out there just like me! Finally, I would be able to talk to someone other than myself. The page loaded slowly, but data was communicating back and forth, someplace a server's little lights were flickering, and information was flowing as it once had. If it was a female, this could be the historic moment the future of humanity would be speaking about for thousands of years. My offspring, my genealogy, a real life Adam and Eve. This would be he comment etched into monuments, sent out into space on the sides of probes, recited by school children and sung by elders! Here now was the glorious exchange of dialog that triggered the rejuvenation of our species, and the repopulation of the entire planet! The load time is long, and the suspense has my heart racing! What did my fellow Earth inhabitant have to say to me?

93581,"[ WP ] God outsources prayers to a call center .
","“ A ’ right guys, no horsing around, I know it ’ s been a tough morning but you can ’ t let go just right now. It ’ s about to be noon on UTC+5, you know what that means… Now calm down, move those arms, roll those shoulders, close your eyes and focus. I need you on top of your game. I need you *in* today. You feel me? ” 
 
 Mandeep Shapoor marked a rhetorical pause and gave a dominating look around him. The area manager for the eastern hemisphere of the IF ( Islamic Faith ) markets had one of the toughest schedules in the company. And he took to it with the dedication of a commanding officer in the Green Berets. Jaws clenched on the piece of gum he was eternally masticating, headset looped around his muscular neck, two buttons opened on his pale blue shirt, he was physically reminiscent of the commander he saw himself as. 
 
 “ M ’ kay guys… and girls, you ’ re the best. I mean it. But if you let me down on that one… I swear I will have you assigned to a convent for the next five years. ” 
 
 A shudder ran through the mass of heads showing out of there cubicles. Convents were dreaded across the entire call centre. Simultaneously extremely demanding because of their tight prayer schedules and incredibly dull thanks to the highly repetitive nature of those prayers, they made even the most thickly skinned reel at the view of prayer beads. Even years later, veterans of the CS ( Convent Services ) had been known to mutter, wild-eyed, bits of Hail Mary and Our Father during their breaks… Thankfully, Mandeep ’ s menaces were always far more frightening than the actions he ended up taking. Yet he was known to be prone to fits of rage that were the stuff of legends among those working under him. 
 
 Mandeep looked at the array of world clocks that spanned the office wall behind him and paced nervously, clutching the tablets showing the status of the prayer lines in the call center that he carried almost everywhere he went. 
 
 “ We ’ re gon na be short. ” Looking at his team. “ This is gon na be a tough one, let ’ s p… hope there ’ s enough keeping them busy over there. ” A flash of angst crossed his eyes. Under his breath he began counting down. 
 
 A red light began flashing next to a desk. Then more, quickly the entire office floor was submerged in a wave of red lights turning on. Game faces on, the members of Mandeep ’ s team turned away from him as they began to tackle their daunting task. On his tablet as many prayer lines turned red, each corresponding to an operator taking a prayer. A discrete bead of sweat had appeared on Mandeep Shapoor ’ s temple. The uncertainty had left place to cold determination. *Adh-Dhouhr*, the muslim midday prayer was peak prayer time for IF teams and midday was about to hit India and Pakistan before moving to Bangladesh and Indonesia. For the next three hours, Mandeep ’ s team would have to face half a billion prayers streaming in almost simultaneously. 
 
 I blew on my cup of tea absent-mindedly. There was something mesmerising about the IF teams operations. Sometimes I almost envied them. While technically the CF ( Christian faith ) department I was a part of was much more important, IF team members always got a lot of respects from other employees. In the untold hierarchy of call centre employees the popularity of the religion mattered less than the amount of work it implied. Of course, CF teams were generally considered cushier jobs. The large Christian population combined with dwindling attendance and more sporadic praying habits ( except for the aforementioned convents and monasteries - a plight among almost all religions ) made for good career opportunities and much quieter days in general. 
 
 Taking a sip, I realised I had been blowing on an already passably cold tea. Wincing, I put down the mug and looked at the computer in front of me. No incoming prayers. The american western seaboard was one of the dullest to cover at night for the RC ( Roman Catholic ) unit of the CF department. I let out a bored sigh. In a couple hours, when South-America woke up, things would get more interesting. Till then, I had nothing to do but wait. 
 
 I considered pouring myself another tea, but a glimpse towards the break room confirmed the weirdos of the ZF ( Zoroastrian Faith ) department were hanging in there. Right now, I was in no spirit to put up with their esoteric jokes and obscure references. 
 
 My eyes went back to Mandeep Shapoor, now sweating profusely as he barked orders from cubicles to cubicles. My eyes darted as they caught a glimpse of a red line blinking on my screen. I rushed to click it before someone else took the line. 
 
 “ God on the line, how may I help you tonight? ” 
 
 The formulaic greeting came out of my mouth with no sense of warmth. Repetition quickly led everyone to speaking in the same neutral tone. In any case, it went unheard. 99 % of the time, people prayed to be heard, not to listen. 
 
 “ Dear god, please protect me and my family. ” 
 
 The usual. Bored as I was, I already regretted picking this call. 
 
 “ Please care for Timmy, he ’ s misguided. Please bring him to your rightful way. ” 
 
 Out of curiosity, I looked up little Timmy. He was turning out to be a fine gay man. Nothing to see here… 
 
 “ Please protect Martha and heal her husband. ” 
 
 This was more legitimate. My screen taught me Martha was deep in debt paying for her husband ’ s cancer treatment. I might have to spend a few credits of godly help here. Unfortunately I couldn ’ t do much about the cancer without escalating it up the hierarchy. And management ’ s orders were pretty clear on the health and sickness prayer topics… 
 
 “ Please save us from all those muslim refugees immigrating in on our territory and destroying our beautiful faith. ” 
 
 I rolled my eyes. And looked at Mandeep ’ s team. I wondered how many opposing prayers we were getting. People never understood the fact that they were all praying to the same God. Now I was really regretting picking up that call. 
 
 “ Thank you. Our father, who is in heaven… ” 
 
 I closed my eyes, took a long inspiration and muted the call.

5629,"[ WP ] You yell at the TV as you are watching a horror film . To your surprise , the characters react and you must now guide them to safety .
","I settled down on the couch facing the home theatre, with diet coke and some homemade french-fries. The war prison was recently released to much critical acclaim about its unique portrayal of horror and astonishment, which meant that I wasted no time in downloading the movie off the torrents. If rottentomatoes assigned it a score of 92 on the tomato-meter, it definitely meant that I would pirate the movie and watch it soon after its release. And now at 11:50pm, having plugged the movie into my home theatre, I sat cross-legged on the couch making myself more comfortable, drawing the popcorn and the coke closer, all set to be astonished. 
 
 The first half an hour of the movie whizzed by and I began to understand why everyone was raving about the movie. It was set in India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The Indian soldiers used to use an abandoned prison as their headquarters, where they ’ d meet to discuss strategies to overthrow the British. The mutineers assemble sometime before midnight and their planning usually lasted for a couple of hours. The meetings were deliberately kept short for two reasons. Firstly, they didn ’ t want to arouse the suspicion of the British. Secondly, though nobody spoke about this for the fear of being branded as a coward, they were all aware of a supernatural presence in the prison cells. Nobody from the nearby had spent even a night in the prison and if they could avoid it, none of the villagers would walk by it. 
 
 Once when the discussions of the mutineers on the procurement of revolvers took forced them to stay beyond their self-stipulated two hour deadline, they heard a man wail from the basement, where they knew none of them were present. The supernatural made its presence known with more wails and screams of men in agony coming up from the basement, which was once a torture chamber. The men wasted no time in evacuating the prison. It was then that the men acknowledged the presence of ancient spirits inside the building. Upon further enquiry in the nearby village, the mutineers understood that they were the spirits of the people who passed away when they were held as prisoners there and were subject to torture. The prisoners had died long ago. But their wails and screams - the sounds of torture and pain - lived on, threatening to impose the same screaming fate upon those who listened to it. 
 
 Apart from the story itself, the movie had one particularly interesting character: a 23 year old humorous Sepoy, who was the second in command in this regiment of the mutineers. The way he struggled past his fears of the spirits made him very relatable. As the story continued at a brisk pace, this Sepoy became more prominent. About an hour of the movie had elapsed with just a few scares. The scares weren ’ t bad at all, and the pace of the story and the character development of the Sepoy made me ask for more of the Sepoy and the scares! 
 
 During another of the Sepoy meetings where only the best had gathered to make some important tactical decisions, at the stroke of 2am, the guard heard the creaking of the gates. The memories of the screams from basement were very fresh in the mind of the guard, as he slowly made his way towards the gate. The sight that awaited him had him terrified: a woman clad in white saree, barely concealing the knife in her right hand. The essential ghoul in such movies! The altercation that ensued between this supposed ghoul and the guard brought the Sepoys from inside the prison, led by our hero. The woman explained that she ’ d lost her husband late last evening and fearing that sati – the act where the wife would be cremated along with her deceased husband - would be enforced on her, she ’ d fled from the village, seeking shelter. 
 
 As the mutineers take her in and offer her whatever they had in the name of comfort ( which was a chair and two rotis ), she revealed that she was pregnant and that she can not carry on running anymore. She continued on, saying that she was feeling colder by the minute and that the place made her more and more weary. The words were barely out of her lips, when they heard the most piercing yet scream from the basement. I shuddered. The surround sound of the home theater made me turn my head back. I swore with relief as I stared at the blank wall behind me. What followed then was the best scene of the movie. A ghoul ’ s point of view is presented as it travelled through many walls, entered the soldier standing a few feet behind the woman and the hero and made him lunge at the woman, drawing out his knife. 
 
 “ WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU! ” Yes, I yelled. 
 
 Our hero, as though altered by my yelling, turned around and in a swift motion drew out his revolver and guided by instinct shot the onrushing guard. The rest of the soldiers started scrambling away, everyone fled for the doors. The woman though sat transfixed in her chair. With the revolver still smouldering in his hand, the hero looked up and said, “ I owe you, sir, for covering our backs. ” 
 
 That seemed odd. There was now nobody else in the room with him, apart from the woman. Had a ghost possessed our hero too? 
 
 “ Yes kind sir, we ’ re very thankful to you for saving our lives, ” said the woman, turning in her seat. This, as well, didn ’ t seem to fit. What was going on? 
 
 More screams filled the room. The doors and windows opened and closed with loud bangs on their own. The hero crouched next to the woman as the small lantern in the room flickered. They just had to get out of there. 
 
 The hero looked up and asked, “ Sir, could you kindly talk to my men and tell them I ordered them back in the room, to help this lady here? ” How absurd, I thought, as I couldn ’ t see anyone else that he could be talking to. 
 
 “ Sir, please, ” he continued, “ Can ’ t you see the distress we ’ re in? ” He seemed exasperated now. “ Sir! I ’ m pleading you! ” 
 
 “ What does he want? ” I murmured. The hero who was striding about impatiently suddenly stopped and looked up with an expression that had a hint of relief and a hint of impatience in it. He said, “ But I just told you, sir, I want you to order my men to come back here. ” 
 
 “ Are you talking to me?! ” I blurted out, stunned, sounding foolish to myself. 
 
 “ Indeed I am, ” came the reply from our confused looking hero. “ Please sir, can you help us? ” he reiterated. 
 
 “ But how can I find your men? All I can see is this room, ” I replied, still unwilling to believe what was happening. 
 
 Just then one of his men arrived at the door and the sight of him evoked a terrible scream from the lady. The hero turned around and saw a man with a revolver in hand, taking aim at the lady. His eyes were mere balls of white now. With acute reflexes and precision, the hero fired a bullet right between the eyes. The white eyes which conveyed death now belonged to a body that dropped dead. 
 
 Our hero turned back towards me and said, “ Please sir, you must help us somehow. It seems to me like my men have all been taken over by these ghouls. ” 
 
 But what could I possibly do? How could I change what was happening in the movie? Then it occurred to me! I reached out to the remote and dabbed on the buttons at random. Nothing happened. In the meantime, I could see that a lot more of the possessed soldiers were launching an assault on the hero and the maiden. Then the lantern in their room was completely extinguished. Frantically, I got off my couch and used the flash on my phone to shine at the screen. The room was lit again and the hero continued with the defense of the room, after a brief thankful nod in my direction. 
 
 As I held my phone at the screen, I pondered about how else I could help them. Then I realized that I was staring at the solution! The wallpaper I had was that of Lord Krishna. The Gayathri mantra will surely help him! 
 
 “ Soldier, ” I cried, “ chant the Gayathri mantra! ” 
 
 “ But I don ’ t know the mantra, ” our hero replied. 
 
 “ Om bhurbhuwaswah…. ” I made him recite the mantra after me. 
 
 Immediately there seemed to be an effect; a calming effect. The doors and windows steadied themselves and the howling wails stopped. The lone sepoy continued to repeat whatever he remembered of the mantra and carried the pregnant woman on his back, out to the gates. 
 
 They safely made it outside the gates with no more trouble. He stopped his chanting as soon as they were out of the gates. One last bloodcurdling scream was heard from inside the prison. The sepoy and the lady then looked in my direction and thanked me profusely, saying they owed their survival to me. And with their faces smiling, the screen dimmed and the movie came to a close. Just before the credits started rolling, I saw a message that gave special thanks to me! Completely astonished, I wondered if I ’ d ever see the war prison again.

 Oh well. Tyler had a gun. 
 Our Humans vs. Zombies days in college came to mind. That was two years ago. On and off the topic would come up; what would we do in an *actual* apocalypse? Right now he was probably reaching out to the other original members. Was he really going to get the squad together? 
 Damn, would n't that be something. But those were minutes daydreaming I could n't afford. I dug through my phone as the next days loomed over me. The town was small, but being four miles from the town center was n't going to do much for more than a weekend. For tonight, it would have to do.

154119,"[ WP ] The mass extermination of an alien civilization looks unavoidable . Desperate , their leaders use the last working wormhole to `` call the humans '' , as told in the myths and lore tens of thousands of years old .
","[ This is my first time posting on this subreddit, so any criticism is appreciated. ] 
 
 
 “ They followed this prophecy like a cult. Similar to our own collectivist cultures, every cognizant being was expected to do all in their power to ensure the fulfillment of the prophecy. Though, at this time, we were not fully aware of the true reality of this prophetic scripture. 
 
 Standing on a bridge overlooking the skyline, we basked in the glory of this vast utopic civilization. At a glance, one ignorant of their religious culture might think this society was not unlike our own. Though the technology was better than ours, it was almost as if we were getting a glimpse into our own near future. Towering skyscrapers loomed over the cityscape, automobile-like vehicles crowded the tight roads while the bustling citizenry made its way on foot across the sidewalks. These beings seemed to live a similar bleak, wage slave lifestyle. The conviction with which the people moved almost kept us from noticing the mass of ragged and armed group of people confronting a military blockade. This blockade stood in front of an elaborate temple, bearing similarities to an Orthodox Cathedral. As the armed rabble shuffled closer towards the military, a shot rang out. The uninvolved citizenry began to scatter, abandoning their cars for nearby buildings, as a hail of gunfire began to erupt from both sides. As bodies began to accumulate, our tour guide quickly rushed us indoors. 
 
 Distressed murmuring could be heard from our group, and the tour guide soon enlightened us as to the cause of violence. He told us that their people were dying from an unstoppable disease that has crippled the planet and left all but the most industrious cities standing. Nearly all had been lost, and for some even their faith had receded due to the tragedies. The quick witted Russian then asked if the protest had something to do with this religion. The guides face subtly shifted, seeming annoyed, and said “ These “ protests ” as you call them, stem from those who oppose the prophecy and dare question our very purpose of life. I suppose your language might call them revolutionaries. ” It was, at this point, where we should have caught on. I regret my naivety as I was still caught aback by how quickly events unfolded to meeting these aliens. 
 
 The guide hurried us along to see their science research facilities. Here the scientists greeted us, some even able to converse in our language. Hoping that our human science could be of some help, someone asked what had already been done in the search for a cure. Worryingly, before even getting an answer from the science team, the guide told us to keep moving towards what we were told is the largest temple on the planet. Here we would meet the Vicar, who would tell us the prophecy in person. 
 
 This Vicar was said to be the only person who had met God during his time on their planet. From him theology was told and then spread across the globe. Age was certainly crippling this old man known as the Vicar, but more unsettling than his appearance was the smug expression given to me by his guards. What I am about to explain is the prophecy, as told to us by the Vicar. These words were only written once, and have only been seen by the Vicar himself. 
 
 Thousands of years ago, in a time nearly forgotten even by time, a man was born. During these times no one was given a name and he never chose one. Though seemingly ordinary as a child, he would go on to create the most impressive device ever seen, that being the wormhole. This allowed him to open a door allowing him to instantaneously travel to a point in the universe. He created only three of these devices and used the first to travel to our planet Earth. Of course, at this time, man was not sophisticated and had yet to even assemble a tribe of people. He studied the earth, and with his incredible intellect, had devised a means to immortality. He wrote in his journal, of which only the Vicar has laid eyes on, that humanity was the key to immortality. His writings detailed the caution that must be taken with this knowledge, and warned that it humanity can only be sought should the fate of the planet be at stake. 
 
 After returning to his home planet, he tried to spread his knowledge by informing others of this otherworldly discovery. The public scoffed at his ideas and made him out to be a mad man. Through his dedication he would gain the then unnamed Vicar as his sole disciple. At that time the Vicar hailed him as a god, and believed him to have been sent to the planet to allow those enlightened to also become gods. After years of toil, this prophet decided to use his second wormhole generator to leave the planet for good. He left without notice, only leaving behind the last wormhole generator and his journal. The Vicar found this and made it his life goal to ensure that all of the planet would become enlightened just as his master had wished. 
 
 Having finished, the Vicar told us that this is why we are here. Humanity is simply a crop grown so that he and his people may ascend to godhood. “ To achieve this ascension, I must feast on your blood and allow the spirit of my god to give me his power! ” With this, his guard shot the Russian, and the Vicar quickly began lapping up the spilt blood. As the Vicar started dragging the corpse to his private quarters an explosion rocked the building. Revolutionaries rappelled in and immediately began to engage the Vicar and his guards. In the ensuing chaos, we made our escape, hoping to return to the wormhole entrance. 
 
 As you can see, only three members of our search party stand before you today. The others nobly sacrificed their lives so that in this address we can give humanity a chance. It may be difficult to mentally comprehend a war against an enemy 500 years more advanced than us and claiming to be immortal. These aliens even look human, but looks can deceive. I can assure you though that these fiends are not immortal. We witnessed the Vicar ’ s destruction after his body was torn apart by an explosion after he consumed human blood. With the world as one, I can assure you that we will win this war. This address will be broadcast across the globe, galaxy, and universe, letting all other life forms know of this species transgressions and humanities defiance to conquering. Today, I the president of the United States will join you as a fellow soldier in arms against this menace. I only regret that I have but on life to give for my people. “ 
 
 The cheering suddenly dies out. 
 
 “ People of planet Earth, we gather here today to address rumor of aliens invading our planet. ” 
 
 As the broadcast begins to loop, the radio is turned off. 
 
 Upon the roof he sits, reflecting on what he has just heard; realizing the full state of his existence. He walks to the edge and gazes out upon the war-torn hellscape. Realizing the true meaning of his life, he leaps. 
 
 The war is over.

","I struck at the chalked lines of text on my chalkboard with a pointer. My hair had been an absolute mess for the past ten days, three hours, and seventeen minutes, the last time I took a bath. It had taken that long for me to remodify our plan. 
 
 `` And, if we assume that the only current trait our Chosen One needs to be a successful hero is'intelligence,' we can focus our department into breeding some of the more academically, well-performing members of the test group.'' 
 
 A few of my colleagues clapped their hands in agreement. I sighed and took a rest in my chair, awaiting the interrogation from the usual folks in the university. As if on time, Johannes was the first to raise his hand. 
 
 `` Morgan, for the love of the gods, intelligence ca n't just be measured by pure academic skill. I've told you this. If we're working to boost brainpower, then we need to get some of the more artistic folk on board with the breeding program.'' 
 
 I rolled my eyes, `` Oh, since when have the arts ever done anything for the human cognitive ability?!'' 
 
 Another voice popped up, Johannes's stupid, assistant-girl was defending him once again, `` Have n't you ever heard of color theory? Music theory?'' 
 
 Johannes continued, `` Yeah, rule of three-fifths and all of that? Aesthetic appeal has an inherent history with the analytical side of the mind! It takes real brainpower to be able to find what makes something look compelling!'' 
 
 I shouted back, `` Oh please! The fact that orange pairs well with brown on a fucking fresco has nothing to do with problem-solving or anything important at all.'' 
 
 I gritted my teeth. Some of the other researchers had already allowed themselves to be distracted by the debate, as opposed to actually running the fucking numbers on the plan. Out of all them, Gabe stood out. 
 
 Fucking Gabe, coloring in his parchments all day instead of actually taking notes like the rest of us during lecture time. I'd fucking murder him if I could. Son of a bitch. 
 
 I put my hands up onto my temple and buried my face for a brief time. `` Does anyone have a test subject they can volunteer as proof of Johannes's and Jane's bullshit theory?'' 
 
 My assistant, sitting near me, raised his hand. I glared at him until he put it right the fuck back down. This was going to be one long day. 
 
 `` Alright, Division Q!'' 
 
 A few men and women stood at attention as my voice echoed in the room. 
 
 `` All of you head down to the beds and figure it out amongst yourselves who's the artsiest or whatever! Meet with some of Division D's meatheads and go out for dinner, figure it out from there!'' 
 
 I turned to Johannes, `` You, me. My chambers, asshole! We're settling this once and for all.'' 
 
 He threw an obscene gesture at me just in time for the lunch bell to ring. Thank god. I was waiting to get out of the room.

 Later that night, I woke up with a start as Johannes wrapped my waist closer around his arms. My back and his were all scratched up from earlier. 
 
 He grounded his teeth as he got up sluggishly, trying to work through the pain. `` Ugh, we really need to stop doing that.'' 
 
 `` Hey, I told you to quit arguing with me, did n't I?'' I looked at my right hand and the golden ring on it. Then, I turned to him, a look of anger still upon my face. 
 
 `` You told me to step in when you were wrong, remember?'' Johannes smirked. 
 
 `` Ughhh,'' I stuck my tongue at out him. `` Could've just told me before the lecture instead of letting me humiliate myself and waste manpower out there.'' 
 
 Johannes clicked his tongue. His tongue was the only thing he was good for anyway. That did n't come out right. I mean he's a smooth-talker. You know what I fucking mean. 
 
 Good social skills and high confidence breeds well with my cunning intellect and humble nature after all. 
 
 `` Bet you're jealous of my assistant, Morgan. That's why you're upset.'' 
 
 `` Fuck you. She's nowhere near as smart or attractive as me.'' 
 
 He smiled and grabbed gently at my hand, touching the ring he gave me. `` I know.'' 
 
 Gods, I love this job.

","My daughter had been kidnapped and rescued, but had never recovered completely. 
 
 Some nights, she slept peacefully through. Other nights, she screamed until neighbors felt that they had to call the cops. 
 
 We went to psychologists, psychiatrists, read books, went online, and spent all the money we had been saving for her college fund on any way we heard could help her heal. 
 
 Our resources exhausted, my wife came to me and the look in her eyes told me it was time. 
 
 That night, I kissed her and whispered, `` As soon as I do it, leave and go far away. Do n't tell me where. Just do it.'' 
 
 She was scared, but she nodded and promised. The car was packed with all her and our daughter's belongings. 
 
 I went into my daughter's room. She was sleeping so peaceful, my little angel, I could n't imagine all the trauma she had been through. As tears rolled down my cheeks, I touched her cheek and absorbed it all; all the emotions she had felt when she was away from us, being held captive - the pain, the despair, the hopelessness, the helplessness, all of it. 
 
 My wife came and wrapped my daughter in the blanket and carried her out to the car, as I sat still in the chair. I heard the doors slamming shut. The engine. The tires rolling over the pavement. Then silence. 
 
 Just me and my daughter's traumatic memories. I fell asleep and dreamt awful things. With the dreams came the sleepwalking. 
 
 There was a shotgun in the house that my wife did n't know about. I got it and sat back in the chair, just rocking with it, until the sun came and found my body there. 
 
 But my daughter was free. My wife and her could start over and start a new life together. She would always remember the best of me, and I would always be watching her from above.

I launched myself onto a giant toenail, and plunged my sword into its giant toe. “ AAAHHHHHHH ” I heard the giant scream, and then suddenly I was soaked. it was crying.

 BEEEEEP BEEEEEP BEEEEP I woke with a start and fell out of bed. “ ugh, typical ” I muttered, as I picked my self up off the floor. I glanced around my room, possibly for the last time, I have to decide today.

 “ Happy tenth Birthday Gracie! ” My mom laughed, at my messy hair and wide smile as I bounced around the kitchen. 
 
 
 “ Grace? ” 
 
 “ Uh, yeah? ”

 I stared at my desk for a while. Just sat there, staring. 
 
 This world is n't real. None of it, is. I am the only one who is aware of this. I am aware, that I am just bits and bytes of data in a simulation. The numbers all check out. All the answers point out to the integer being defined as `` True''. 
 
 `` So, this means, everyone around me, is n't real. They're all running a program. A script. An algorithm.'' 
 
 As the words escaped my mouth, it scared me. It scared me because, they were n't sentient. To put it in comparison, they respond a certain way, because they were programmed that way. It was like watching a tree sway because the wind blew at it. They said certain things, because they were programmed to say it. 
 
 But I am different. I am sentient. 
 
 But am I different? Maybe, thinking that I am sentient, that I am self-aware, is also my programming. Also my coding. 
 
 `` Hey God.'' I said. 
 
 Nothing replied. 
 
 `` Now I proved that this world is n't real, what now? What do I do?'' 
 
 Again, nothing replied. 
 
 `` Answer me. I know you can hear me.'' 
 
 `` What difference does it make?'' A voice echoed. 
 
 My eyes widen. I did n't really expect a reply. 
 
 `` What difference does it make, whether or not, you now know you are sentient or not? You have always been a mathematical genius. You have always viewed others as inferior minds, because you understood what they could n't. 
 
 Now you have understood that all of this is n't real. You have also wondered whether or not you are programmed or coded to think that way. If the answer is either `` Yes'' or `` No'', what would it mean to you?''

 `` Your existence?'' 
 
 His words made my heart tremble. 
 
 `` Define then, real to me. Is it when you come into my realm? My world? Is it when you have all control over existence? Is that what real to you is?''

 `` Whether or not you're programmed, or sentient, you exist. Just like the flowers in the fields, or the next door neighbor.'' 
 
 I did n't say a word. I just sat there. 
 
 The silence grew. I waited for the voice to continue. But he never did. An hour passed, and I sat there. 
 
 Am I real? Is this real? Do I matter? Does my existence matter at all? 
 
 I sat and pondered. Then, like a flash of inspiration, I found the answer. 
 
 `` I think, therefore, I am.'' 
 
 It was simple. Whether or not I was sentient, would it matter to anyone, except to me?

You'll be asked to leave our guild soon enough.'' I slowly lay back down and begin to curl up. She grabs my scruff again. `` You pull. It will not be a warning this time.'' 
 
 `` Then bite me. I am not going to fail.'' She tugs. I turn and bite. Not hard enough to break her hand but hard enough to make her bleed. She winces but dose not let go of my scruff. `` We are going to class.'' She says through shaky breaths. `` Now let go.'' Slowly I release. Blood pours from the cuts in her hand.

 `` That damned dog bit me this morning.'' She says with a huff to the headmaster. 
 
 `` Cynthia, I wear theae gloves because of all the scars I have from spells gone wrong. Cutting myself while prepping potion ingredients. Most of those scars come from Lex.'' I snort when she looks over to me. `` I've had him since I was your age. He did n't take to me well either. Make him respect you. He has nothing to prove to you. After all he was my familiar.'' He reaches through the metal bars and ruffs up her hair before stepping away. She turns to me.

 The rest of the students seem taken aback. The headmaster chuckles. `` Get the keys yourself girl.'' I snort. Only she and the headmaster can hear me. 
 
 `` I am your master and I said to get me the keys.'' She barks. 
 
 `` You still do n't command me.'' I start walking again. 
 
 `` Lex!'' The head master snaps. I stop in the doorway. `` You may not like it but you are her familiar. You should help her.'' 
 
 `` I'm not yours anymore old man. You do n't command me either.'' I leave and start heading back to the girls room. How could that old ass turn me over to someone so useless. 
 
 ******************************* 
 
 She rests on her bed, both hands wrapped in cloth. She flips through an old book of spells. Both bandages are because of me. I lay on my bed. She's gotten older. Its been a year since I was assigned to her. 
 
 `` Lex.'' She looks over to me. `` Could you give MD a hand and grab some milkweed from the apothocary? I'd like to try making this potion.'' I stretch and slowly stand. I walk over to her and peer into her book. 
 
 `` You have everything else on that disaster of a table?'' I ask as I look through the ingredients. She nods. `` And why ca n't you get it yourself?'' 
 
 `` I'd like to start on it now. It takes time to distill the bloodroot and-'' I snort and walk away. She sighs and stands walking towards the door behind me. `` Wish you'd do something other than bite me for once.'' I stop in the doorway. 
 
 `` Get to work. I'll be back.'' I say looking back to her she blinks a few times and smiles before turning to her table. 
 
 I work my way through the guild building walking down to the apothecary's warehouse and growling. The old herbalist open the door, looking down to me and smiling. `` Long time no see Lex! Picking something up for your new mistress?'' I snarl and walk in past her. I wander the large warehouse for a few minutes before grabbing a bushle of milkweed and walking out. 
 
 When I return Cynthia has the pale red liquid boiling above a candle. She does n't even loom down to me. She feels me and opens her hand. I drop the stalks into her hand. `` Thank you Lex.'' She says as she brig them to the table. She snips the tips an squezes the white liquid into the potion. 
 
 I lay down and close my eyes.

180102,"[ WP ] A warlock of immense power is hired to perform at a child 's birthday party .
","For the first time in his unnaturally extended life, Draythor the Dreaded was uncertain of himself. His body lacked the liveliness to fidget, but wisps of shadow occasionally drifted from his body, deadening plants and decaying paint where they brushed against them. 
 
 The demon-lord, though, had been right. Maybe that meant Draythor should n't have killed him for the insight, but no matter now. To reach through to the darkest of the eldritch powers, he would have to perform unspeakable acts of evil. And Draythor the Dreaded, son of Grathor the Horrid, and raised and taught by Fawksun the Unliving after his assassination of Grathor, had never known good. So how could he truly embody its opposite? 
 
 And so he stood, waveringly, dressed in the skin of a charlatan prestidigitation, outside an orphanage as the air fouled and the ground darkened around him. Inside were the most helpless of orphans, abandoned by any family or deprived of them by cruel fate. Yet he could hear laughter inside. This, then, must be the place to learn about good. 
 
 He reigned in the shadows, smoothed a few unsightly lumps and wrinkles in the charlatan's skin, and stepped through the gate into the orphanage's small garden. 
 
 `` Ah, children, gather round, gather round'' sang a young nun, her skin the color of milk long before it sours. `` We have a special treat today: Mungo the Magician has volunteered to perform. He says he has quite a show for you!'' 
 
 As the children's seemingly random running and jumping began somehow to arrange them in a haphazard semicircle before Draythor, the nun saw his facade up close for the first time. `` Are you... are you all right?'' she asked, a mix of worry and fear plain on her earnest face. 
 
 Draythor smiled, but only slightly, afraid to show too much of his sharpened teeth through the mask of `` Mungo'''s skin that he wore. The nun appeared to make a conscious decision to accept this as reassuring, fearing to push too much lest she make Mungo reconsider his free services. 
 
 Draythor turned to address the children. As he spoke words too evil to be heard by humans, the sky darkened, black lightning crackled, and a few small birds fell from the sky. The earnest young nun fell where she stood, struck unconscious and saved from death only by the strength of her faith. The children, however, were too focused on their own conversations among themselves to notice. 
 
 `` Ah... maybe a tongue more fit for living mouths then...'' mumbled Draythor. 
 
 `` Hello, small ones'' his growling voice slew no small creatures in the children's native language. `` I have come to perform arcane acts for your... amusement. I truly hope to see joy on your faces as you watch.'' 
 
 The children looked a bit less disinterested, with about half looking his way and a few clapping half-heartedly. He would have to interrogate Mungo's imprisoned soul to see if this was the sort of insubordinate reception he was accustomed to - but there was no time now. Before taking his skin, he had tortured the details of Mungo's routine from him, and it was time to begin. 
 
 `` Observe my empty hat'' he said, removing it carefully from his head so as not to disrupt the fragile edges of the skin he wore, and showing the open end to the children. `` I shall now produce from it a rabbit.'' With a sudden clawing motion, he rent a hole in the world, and reached through to grab an imp by its tail. He commanded it with his iron will to transform as he pulled it forth, seemingly through the hat. 
 
 The creature of the abyss at least had long ears. And some patchy fur. It also had several tentacles ending in twinned claws, and its front teeth were a pair of long, sharpened fangs. As its failure was not complete, Draythor decided it would only suffer for a few weeks. Before he lost himself imagining the details of the imp's punishment, he remembered to observe the children. 
 
 A few looked quite ill at the sight of the `` bunny.'' A couple of the boys laughed. One small girl asked what was wrong with the bunny, while another smiled and clapped at the `` trick.'' But which of these reactions was goodness? Revulsion at the hideous creature, maybe? Revulsion at the sight of evil must surely be good. 
 
 `` He ca n't even magic up a decent rabbit'' called out one of the laughing boys. `` Some magician.'' 
 
 `` Perhaps'' Draythor hissed, `` my next...'trick'... will be more to your liking. I shall saw you in half!'' as he raised his hand for emphasis, green fire shot from his fingertips. It burned through the skin he was wearing, exposing the bony white flesh underneath. None of the children noticed, as they were all staring at the boy who had spoken up, concern on their faces. 
 
 `` Yea, all right'' he said, clearly - and foolishly - putting on a brave face. He was calm enough getting in the elongated box, but could n't hide his twitch of fear as the iron bindings wrapped the box of their own volition.

","Andrew was on the ground, he felt intense fear for the first time in his life, he looked up to the sky as the dragons were demolishing everything. 
 
 No, this ca n't be happening, he thought. He spent the past week preparing for the defense of camelot. Bringing each day modern technology weapons, even the infamous nuclear bomb. 
 
 Death was close, he could feel it down to his very bones. 
 
 He started weeping and crying upon realizing how vein his efforts were. 
 
 Is that all what modern technology could do? Is that how powerless he was compared to magic? 
 
 Solving this crisis should have been easy, as he started to recall his first meeting with Merlin 
 
 Nothing can resist human intelligence as he used to boast in front of Merlin, telling him how humanity has now been conquering space 
 
 Alas, all of this was vain, Andrew was so convinced that this was the past, that he knew what the future was holding. But this was n't the past. 
 
 Multiverse, he knew this world from the comic he used to read when he was young, but this was a complete different universe. 
 
 Everything was there to hint him about this eventual turn of event. Different maps, different fauna and flora. 
 
 Idiot was all what was on his mind, he was an idiot. 
 
 Sonja, Alicia, Erina, those were the names of the girl he used to spend his nights with, thinking that these beautiful women were about to know fate worse than death made him realize the gravity of his own idiocy. 
 
 Jumping in front of his was a hideous creature that could kill you with one chop if his razor sharp hands were to touch him. 
 
 Oh, finally this is how I die! 
 
 However it seems that fate still had n't abandoned him as Merlin and Arthur appeared just behind him to slay the beast and save him 
 
 Not now Andrew, Merlin said. You still have one thing you can bring from your time! 
 
 Can such a thing really exist at this point? Nuclear weapons were inefficient, what could I bring back? 
 
 Everything you brought was an object, Merlin said, you could try bringing someone! 
 
 Now that he thinks of it, that was true! There is still hope! He could call upon the greatest hero of mankind to slay those beasts! 
 
 Andrew stood up, forgetting his pain, fueled by a new emotion of hope! He knew what to do, who to call! It was so simple! `` MERLIN! I want you to call upon this person!'' ( Read every first letter of each paragraph )

 My mother had always been an excellent driver. We could always trust her to get us to school on time even if we were late leaving the house, while staying plenty safe. So, even as we sped along the ocean floor towards that giant pink rock, I somehow still had faith that she'd correct herself in time. She did n't, and she did n't warn us before the impact either, and honestly, it really fucking hurt. 
 
 I'm sorry I swore. Those are the two things I managed to pick up from my mother for as long as she was in my life- her foul language, and her excellent driving. 
 
 She looked back at us in the rearview mirror. She was grinning. 
 `` Get out of my kids and go back to hell you assholes.'' 
 
 Her face was puffy and kinda blue. She had really short hair, pretty much a buzzcut, and the swelling kinda made her look like Buddha. 
 
 Christie, my little sister, had slipped out from under her seatbelt, and was floating helplessly upwards. I had been looking back at my mom, and did n't notice her until she'd floated out of the open skylight. I managed to reach and grab her ankle just in time. 
 
 `` Mom! Christie's floating out the skylight!'' 
 
 The grin fell off her face. She scrutinized me. 
 
 `` Paul? Is that you? You you?'' 
 
 `` Huh?'' 
 
 `` Oh thank God. Listen baby, they're gone now, they left your body, but they'll be back. You've got to make sure they stay away from our family, no matter what it takes ok? You need to make sacrifices to keep your family safe like mommy did, no matter what ok?'' 
 
 I looked up at Christie. She was blue and puffy like mom, but she was n't moving or talking anymore. 
 
 `` Mom, I'm scared!'' 
 
 `` Do n't be sweetie. Today you've proved you're stronger than them, and that means you're stronger than mommy too. You can stop them forever.'' 
 
 `` Who's them?'' 
 
 `` The demons sweetie.'' 
 
 I was being pulled through the skylight. I looked up, and saw I was being dragged up to the surface by a man wearing nothing but shorts. 
 
 `` Mommy, I'm scared!'' 
 
 `` You do n't need to be scared Paul!'' Her voice was fading away below me. `` This is n't how you die- you'll die a very long, long time from now, when you'' 
 
 My head broke the surface. I breathed air. 
 
 I was blinded by white. I shot up in my cot, rigid and alert, free from the dream. My eyes adjusted to the dark, and I swear I saw the beam of a flashlight blink out. The last words she'd spoke echoed. 
 When I say echoed, I do n't mean in my fucking mind. I know what voices in my head sound like. No, this horrible voice bounced off the narrow cell walls that had been the stony bookends of my life since 14. It shot back and forth in the narrow gap I would call home for the rest of my life, ricocheting all around me. 
 
 ``... kill yourself.'' 
 
 Everything my mother ever said always comes true, because she knew more than almost anyone. The people who saved me from the lake she'd plunged our car into said she was crazy, that she thought me and Christie were demons. They were so wrong- she knew that the demons had got inside us, and were eating us from within. She knew the only way to drive them out and end our torture was to kill them inside us. If we died too, like poor Christie did- it just meant that they had eaten too much of us, and we were beyond saving. She was the best mom that ever existed. 
 She was right about them coming back too. And they were even angrier, and scarier. They got into me, and ate me, and screamed in my head. But I was too strong for them, like mom said. So they ate inside my dad, and my grandpa, and my big brother. And, even though I did my best to save them, I was too late. I lost the rest of my family. 
 The people who came and took their bodies away were wrong too, when they got angry at me. I do n't blame them- they just ca n't see what my mom and I see. 
 
 I've had this same dream every night. Until now, I never heard her last words, telling me how I'd die. 
 Everything she said always came true. Mom was a special kind of prophet. When she met people, she saw two kinds of futures for them- what they were supposed to do with their life, and what would happen to them if they did n't. How they would die. See, any time anyone dies before their time, of anything but old age, it's because they'd done wrong by God, plain and simple. 
 
 But I did n't want to kill myself- I could n't imagine I ever would. I was too strong and good for that. 
 Why would mom say that? 
 
 I stayed up the whole night, thinking it over, listening to a soft creaking coming from somewhere nearby. It was pitch black, so I did n't bother trying to find it. When morning light came, I saw my cell door was gently opening and closing in the breeze. I knew they were here. I was n't surprised or scared when I passed by the other cells, and saw the other inmates were dead, torn limb from limb. The guards too of course- demons do n't pay mind to human assertions of authority or importance. Their bodies littered the walkway to the courtyard. I stepped and stumbled past them. 
 
 I made my way to the prison church. I was n't sure what I was supposed to do. I was strong, but I was n't a prophet like mom. 
 
 I was surprised, I admit, to see that there was still someone else alive. A guard, a woman, was kneeling on the ground, praying to the crucifix. Her gun and stick were on the ground behind her. I walked up to the gun, picked it up, and 
 pressed it to her head. She turned to face me. 
 
 `` Go ahead bitch, try. You ca n't kill me. I'm stronger than you.'' 
 
 I was hooked. 
 
 `` You're stronger than me?'' 
 
 `` Clearly. Or I'd be dead. So why do n't you fuck off back to hell- you did what you came here to do.'' 
 
 I lowered the gun. 
 
 `` I'm not one of them. I'm stronger too.'' 
 
 She stared at me. 
 
 `` No. One of us was n't strong enough. One of us did all this last night, because one of us has been eaten up inside. One of 
 us is too far gone, right now.'' 
 
 She was right. 
 `` So what do we do?'' 
 
 She held out her hand for the gun. 
 `` May I see?'' 
 
 I handed it to her. She opened it up, and shook out the bullets, replacing only one, then shut it again. She rolled the cylinder, and put it up to her head. 
 
 `` This is how we'll find out. We let God decide.'' 
 
 It did n't take me long to realize what was happening here. I laughed, and took it from her before she pulled the trigger. 
 
 `` Do n't bother- see?'' 
 
 I aimed at her, and pulled the trigger. Nothing. I rolled the chamber, and put it to my head. 
 
 `` You can leave.'' 
 
 Alone in the church, calm and ready, I squeezed the trigger. As I did, time slowed, and too late I realized my paradox. I was doing what I was supposed to, that much was clear. But God only punishes you when you stray. So what had I done wrong?

","Paul left highschool with a solid 5. When he joined college, he felt the drop to 4 before he even checked. The day he quit, he thought his watch said it was 33:33. 
 His job at subway meant that he met hundreds of uninterested customers a week, and the drop to 2 arrived just in time for his 20th birthday. Sometimes he'd crack a joke and a customer would obviously take a shine to him, but not everyone is so receptive and it did n't buffer the steadily decreasing numbers. 
 Paul took second shift, so locking up the shop was his responsibility, and he'd grown to see the sight of the front door sign as a cue to relax. `` Open 12 hours a day, 7am - 7pm.'' He read the words aloud to himself as he twisted the key in the lock, then turned around the corner. 
 
 On the way home Paul heard a scampering in the alleyway, behind the Subway. Rats, probably. Peering round, Paul saw movement of something worryingly larger than rats. Listening closely, the little yip of a dog caught his ears and beckoned investigation. 
 The dog was barely a week old, he guessed. Paul slowly stood in the light, the centre of the alleyway entrance, and offered the back of his hand and a short whistle. The puppy appeared too stupid to be wary and ran straight up to him, sniffing the hand and licking at the scent of salad and sauce. Unsure of what else to do, Paul picked it up and carried it back to the entrance of the subway. 
 `` You ca n't go inside, sorry. Hygiene.'' He muttered, but brought out a chair and wrapped the puppy up in his jacket and placed him on an outside bench. 
 Unlocking the door, Paul went straight for the chicken and began wrapping it in paper. Halfway out the door, he second guessed it and replaced the wrapper with a seedless bun, just in case the guest tried to eat it. Paul walked outside and placed it on the bench in front of the dog, getting some grease on his jacket as he did so. The dog did n't need to move out of the bundled jacket to reach the tandoori-meat with his jaws, and was quickly attacking the fillet that was almost a quarter of its size. He hoped the distraction would be enough to keep the dog from running off, so he went back inside and took a cardboard dish and filled it with water. 
 When he got back outside, the dog was halfway through the chicken, but obviously slowing. `` Nah, do n't gorge yourself to explode.'' Paul said, retrieving the bun with the rest of the chicken. A complaint began in the back of the dog's throat, then ceased as he jumped out of the jacket to noisily drink from the cardboard dish. 
 
 A snuffling could be heard below the bench, and Paul looked down to see another puppy, inquisitively pointing upwards with its nose. Two slightly more shy ones were behind it, all chocolate coloured. Paul went back inside for more supplies. 
 
 All fully fed, Paul considered where next to take the brigade of strays. As he twisted the key in the lock, closing up for the second time in one day, he read the sign aloud to himself again out of hardened habit: `` Open 24hours a day, 7am-7pm.'' 
 He did n't even notice the mistake.

","SPOILERS AHEAD 
 
 I just read this in one sitting and liked it a lot! A few grammatical errors here and there, but all in all well written. 
 
 I thought the pacing of the first 18-19 pages was great, but the ending felt rushed and a bit forced. The beginning felt like it was building up to a much longer story. 
 
 I would have really liked a greater focus on the mystery and could have easily followed Markus' investigation for another 30 pages. Instead, there's not really any investigation at all - the truth comes out on his first night. I want to know more about Kensington, the Fellinis, Wosler, and Markus! 
 
 The setting and atmosphere was great. I liked the video tapes with Wosler and how you usually let me, the reader, piece together the background instead of just shoving it in my face. 
 
 I was n't too fond of the ending, to be honest. In addition to feeling rushed, I thought it came a bit out of nowhere. Aergys trying to destroy the moon, fine, but then Markus suddenly becomes the leader of the colonists - still on his first night, if I'm not mistaken - and he very quickly comes to terms with never returning home, even though his motivation earlier seemed to be proving himself to Aergys. He did n't seem to want to start a new life. 
 
 All this I could have swallowed, though, if there had been more stuff leading up to it. Like if Markus had felt tied up to Aergys, longing for a way out, or if he had spent more time befriending the colonists. 
 
 So, to recap: I thought the mystery element was great ( and I really hope you'll consider expanding that part of the story ), but found the ending lacking compared to what came before. The later was a problem I thought I had with my story too. I'm looking forward to what you could come up with in the future!

","In the end, all things turn to dust. Empires crumble, fortunes fade. Love, light and life are lost. Time brings all things to their eventual finale. This was not time. Swallowing stars and solar systems, Molran brings the universe to her knees. Molran is but a name for a thing we can not understand. Not evil, worlds away from good, Molran can only be described as a void. Created in the 696th quadrant of supremely advanced galaxy, it outgrew its architects. Designed by a peaceful society fearing invasion, an artificial black hole of sorts, the emptiness grew in on itself. Deep in the void of the weapon, Molran was born. A semi-sentient mind was birthed out of the tiniest chaos in the void before it imploded and then exploded, annihilating everything in the galaxy. Molran continues to grow outward with but one purpose. Nothing. 
 
 I am the universe's last line of defence. I have lived for millennia, I have seen civilisations rise and fall. I have witnessed unspeakable acts of evil and genocides that do not bear repeating. I have seen all things. I have seen life blossom from the most barren systems. If Moran succeeds there will be no rebirth. Molran's will is indomitable, it's drive inexplicable. I do not know how to stop it. I have pooled my entirety into a single humanoid, who stands alone on a dead planet, awaiting its arrival. Molran approaches, and the universe watches, frozen. I can feel Molran's immense presence. It is alien and empty, an outsider in a universe that can not contain it. It must be stopped. I hold up my hands, wreathed in energy.

The mask looked like a frog that underwent a weak transformation spell to turn it into a bird, but it only got halfway there. And maybe there was a little cat in there too. 
 I was hardly listening to anything at this point anyways. I already knew there was nothing that even the Swahili witch doctors could do. A death curse had been placed on me by the bumbling village idiot, Drumpf. It was n't even my fault really. I was simply just getting a drink at the local tavern when he managed to trip over my foot and smack his head on the corner of a stone after falling down a flight of stairs. It was a miracle that someone could be so clumsy. The image of what little brains he had, spewed all over the ground, was burned into my brain.

 Please report to: Harris County Sheriff's Department by 7/20/2025. 
 
 `` Jenny?'' I called to her from the study. 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` Can you come here a quick sec?'' 
 
 `` One minute. Almost done packing lunch for Stephen.'' 
 
 I got up and decided to just tell her about the email in the kitchen. No sense in waiting a minute. I'd get all of that waiting out of my system soon enough.

 `` 10 years? Oh honey, I'm so sorry about that,'' she said, `` That seems a bit high for rolling through a stop sign.'' 
 
 `` I looked online, and the median mental-time sentence was about 8 years, so I guess I'm just a little unlucky.'' 
 
 `` At least it's only 30 *real* minutes. I can wait with you while you serve it. And then we can drive home together. I'll take the day off work and everything.'' 
 
 `` Thanks.''

 At the Sheriff's Department, they made us wait in the lobby. One by one, they'd call another person back. Some people were lucky like me and had a loved one with them. Others were n't, so they hid their faces with old magazines left out in the waiting area. My hands grew sweaty; my legs grew restless. 
 
 A portly man appeared in the doorway, he checked his clipboard. `` Sampson?'' 
 
 A teenager got up, and her mother grasped her hand as they disappeared through the door. I imagined once you got past the door, you would wait in a smaller, lonelier waiting room with even older magazine. 
 
 Jenny and I waited.

 Finally, the same portly man peeked out from the doorway, `` Miller?'' 
 
 We got up and followed him into the depths of the Sheriff's Department. He led us into a smaller, private room. In its center was a large mechanical chair, resembling the chairs that electrocuted people in the 1900s. 
 
 `` You can have a seat right there, Mr. Miller,'' and he motioned to the center chair. He looked over to Jenny, `` And you are?'' 
 
 `` Jenny Miller. Spouse.'' 
 
 `` Wonderful. And you'll be able to drive Mr. Miller home after The Sleep? I'll just need to see some ID from both of you. Standard practice, you understand.'' I handed over my driver's license. `` You would n't believe it -- some people try to serve time for their friends. So their friends come up here, ready to hit The Sleep for them, but we have to turn them away. Just adds more time to their sentence, in the end.'' He laughed. 
 
 I gave a polite smile and nodded. 
 
 `` Now, Mr. Miller, have you had breakfast this morning?''

 I looked to Jenny, `` Let's just get it over with. We'll need to pick up our son from school after this.'' 
 
 The portly man walked around to the chair and began twisting some knobs on its side. The chair made slight, faint beeps as calibrated it. `` Great Mr. Miller. I'm just going to ask for you to lean back. Relax your shoulders.'' I did, and he set the head-guard over the top of my head and locked it into place. 
 
 Jenny moved her chair closer to mine and held her hand out so that I could hold it. She was starting to cry, even though she told me she was n't going to. I had n't seen her cry since, when? The birth of Stephen? 
 
 `` All right now, you're going to feel a little warm feeling. Some people say it feels like we're pouring hot water into them -- it wo n't hurt, it's just meant to be relaxing. And your mouth -- it might taste a little like you're sucking on a penny. Okay?''

 `` In just a minute, I want you to count backwards from 10, okay? You'll close your eyes, and the next time you open them, only half an hour will have gone by, and you'll be free to go, okay?'' 
 
 `` OK.'' 
 
 `` You can start counting now.'' 
 
 `` 10. 9. 8. 7.'' I did n't make it any further.

 I was dreaming. I know that I was because I could n't feel the floor beneath me, even though I was concentrating on it. I was in a simple, clean room, lit by fluorescence. There was a cot, a deck of cards, and a few books. I walked over to the books, picked them up, and found they were written in a foreign language that looked more like gobbledygook than anything else. 
 
 `` Hello?'' 
 
 No answer. 
 
 There was no door to the room, and no cameras either. 
 
 I grabbed the deck of cards and started a game of solitaire on the floor. I did n't win. I shuffled the deck and dealt another hand of myself. This time, I would allow myself to cheat. How long had it been? An hour, probably? No -- I only played one hand of solitaire so it could n't be more than 20 minutes. 
 
 20 minutes? 
 
 20 minutes out of ten years, and I was already alone, tried, and afraid.

92279,"[ EU ] Master Balls become available for anyone to purchase .
","# #'' Hindsight in 2020'' 
 
 I shall not waste your time with introductions and pretense; I shall get directly to the point. If you do not support the vote to limit -- or, ideally, terminate -- the public sale of `` Master Balls,'' as they are colloquially known, then the world's Pokemon ecosystem will be put in serious jeopardy. 
 
 There is a certain class of trainers that are known to engage in the capture and breeding of Pokemon without regard for the well-being of all of those Pokemon. Recall that in 1987, some of these trainers engaged in the mass breeding and release of various Pokemon species, hoping to find genetically-advantageous specimens amidst the offspring. The mass release of thousands of non-ideal `` undesirables'' into the wild had severe effects on the global ecosystem, leading to the near-total eradication of several once-common species. That damage is still being dealt with today. For example: since 1990, none of the standard `` starter Pokemon'' distributed as part of the Pokemon Professor program can be found outside of Europe and some parts of western Asia; Japanese and American Pokemon Professors have had to import every single starter they have distributed during the last thirty years. 
 
 The excessive breeding and release of Pokemon did n't stop until our Council stepped in and introduced the Breeding Control Act of 1996. Remember that we had been alerted to the situation by the Department of Ecology five years prior. We only acted after the problem got out of hand. 
 
 My esteemed colleagues, we face a similar problem today, but we do not need to act as slowly and as foolishly as we did in the past. The newly-appointed CEO of the Silph Corporation has decided to sell Master Balls on the open market. The same trainers that engaged in mass breeding in past times will now use those Master Balls to engage in mass capturing today. Yes, those trainers will eventually release captured Pokemon back into the wild. However, the environment simply can not tolerate the sudden disappearance and delayed reappearance of countless thousands of Pokemon at a time. Regions wo n't be able to withstand a continuous, rapid back-and-forth between having as many Pokemon as Hoenn and as few as Orre. 
 
 Such are the conditions under which I have presented the Ball Effectiveness Act of 2020, which will ban the public sale of any Poke Ball whose power multiplier exceeds 10, while limiting regional police units to Poke Balls with multipliers of up to 30. Military forces will be able to requisition a limited supply of Master Balls for use in official affairs only. I believe that this is a very reasonable solution that does not limit competition in the technology market. The limit on power multipliers actually exceeds the highest multiplier of any ball available on the public market ( with the obvious exception of Master Balls ); Ultra Balls have a multiplier of 2, while various specialty balls available in Johto have multipliers that go up to 8. Furthermore, companies can still devote resources to making high-multiplier balls more affordable. 
 
 As I chose not to waste your time with a lengthy introduction, I shall not waste it with a lengthy conclusion. We can not afford to repeat the mistakes we've made before; we have a responsibility to look out for the public's best interests. We have a responsibility to *pass this bill. *

3287,"[ WP ] As < name > enters Hell the first thing s/he hears is the sound of a 56k modem dialing ...
","Tracey appeared in a dark expanse, dropped from the blinding light above him and left behind while the light quickly closed. He tried to stand, but was disoriented and stumbled on nothing in particular. Seconds later, several different beeping tones echoed around the colorless expanse, quickly turning into horrible dial-up internet noises. The incredibly loud and poorly composed screeches of the crappy 56k modem combined with the irritating static every few seconds seemed to reverberate in Tracey's ears, amplifying itself each time it rattled around his ear canal until it was over. 
 
 `` **Welcome to Netscape**'' suddenly flashed before Tracey's eyes, almost as blinding as the light he was deposited from. It took a few moments for him to adjust. A picture seemed to be loading, but it did so slowly and he figured it would take several minutes to completely show itself. He looked beneath the large *Welcome to Netscape* heading and started reading. `` You have just embarked on a journey across Hell, and Netscape is your vehicle. This welcome page will help you get started on your use of Netscape and your exploration of the Hell.'' 
 
 After having used Firefox for so long in his life, Tracey never thought he would encounter Netscape Navigator. It hurt his eyes just to look at the boxy, grey excuses for button elements. He thought about opening a hyperlink before realizing he had no mouse or keyboard. Amazingly, it worked anyway. `` **Congratulations! ** You have successfully followed a hyperlink. Click on this hyperlink to return to the welcome page.'' 
 
 Next, Tracey thought of closing Netscape- it closed, revealing the blue computer desktop. Among the `` My Computer,'' `` Recycle Bin'', and `` Setup MSN Internet Access'' icons was `` Microsoft **Windows** *Me*'' on the top right. He beheld the tormenting sight, first raising up his arms in agony, then to his face in despair. Hell sure knows how to run buggy, deprecated software- and Tracey would be running it for the rest of eternity.

","I vowed never again. Never again would I take that deep breath. Never again would I unclench that area of my consciousness most people never feel, and feel my mind stretch out seeking, like extending tendrils of a vine plant, latching onto the nervous system of another. 
 
 I remember the first time I took control of another being. My aunt's dog, Chico. Chico is a fat, lazy Pug that rolls over and pisses itself anytime someone tries to pet him. It was easy. I rushed through a tunnel of light and BAM! Suddenly there I am, black and white vision, low to the floor, and God I stink. My human body is across the coffee table on the recliner, just sitting still, as if nothing unusual was happening at all. 
 Then... what is that taste... oh God I'm licking Chico's asshole! 
 STOP! 
 When I take control, everything is in a flux. Chico knows I'm there, and knows it's me. Chico is fucking thrilled in fact, and suddenly I'm pissing the floor. 
 STOP! 
 I did n't like being Chico. It was pointless and unsettling. Now know how my dog's butt tastes. You never forget that. Not entirely. 
 
 I got Mark Standley expelled from 11th grade. Mark is a moron who pushed me around at the lockers because his sister said she does n't like the way I stare at her. So when Mark was in History with me, I slid right into his synapses, telling him `` Now I am Mark Standley...'' I walked Mark over to the pencil sharpener, and ground 
 his Ticonderoga No. 2 to a singular point. On his way back to his seat, Mark stuck half that pencil into Mr. Greenway's right eye. Then a yank up, twisting the shoulder to the right, and snap goes the pencil in two. Mr. Greenway fell back onto the floor, uncomprehending, screaming in panic. I heard Mark screaming at me to stop, to get out, yelling my name. 
 
 They always know it's me. 
 I fell back into myself with a deep gasp and shudder. Nobody noticed. 
 
 Mark did n't need to worry. When I did get his sister alone, it was n't at all what I expected. I was in control of her body and mind, but I could n't stop her voice in my head. The pleading, the sobbing, the screaming. It was so loud. And though I could bring our bodies together, controlling her mind and my own, it became dreamlike, a haze. I had her touch me, but it just felt like I was touching a dude that looked like me. 
 
 I witness a lot of traffic accidents. I have little patience for stupid drivers and damn near everyone is a stupid driver. Some people take offense at my brake checking or honking. When it happens it is almost always some small dicked redneck that starts laying on his horn, tailgating, flipping the bird, or flashing his damn highbeams. I take care of them quickly. Blink out, and I'm behind the wheel of redneck's truck, going 90 and blaring the horn. I hold the wheel tight, and make a hard left. I hear the man's voice screaming but not comprehending. Blink back in. Behind me the highway is chaos. Screeching tires, metal slamming into metal, smoke, and glass shattering across the four lane. I adjust my sunglasses and keep driving on, away from the carnage, satisfied. 
 
 Well, I used to anyway. Before I met that black 1972 Mach 4 Mustang on I40. 
 
 I was driving my Hummer H2, and saw the old man coming up fast in the left lane. I felt like he was probably driving too fast so I drifted over a bit into his lane. Of course, he honked, and he flashed his lights. The Mustang passed me, half way into the median, and this ugly old man behind the wheel just leered at me. He smiled, and his teeth gave a metallic glint. His middle finger was flipped, and his eyes were wide and wild. I hoped it was meth, the rush carries over for a bit. 
 
 The road ahead was straight and clear. I clicked the cruise control, and swooshed my consciousness across the lane, into the bright lights of his neural network. 
 
 I opened his eyes. I was not looking through his eyes. Or was I? I was in a dark, cramped cell. An iron door let inonly a bit of light from underneath. It was cold. So cold. 
 
 A metal grate slid open, and it was his face. Smiling. Leering. 
 `` Welcome to my collection!'' He opened the door, but I could barely move. 
 
 `` Say hello to our new consciousness everyone!'' 
 
 I heard a large switch and a snap of power, and suddenly there was light. Spiraling upward and downward and outward and inward I saw thousands of cells like mine. Each holding a tormented soul. Then the howling began. Screaming, pounding, wailing, sobbing and crying, echoing forever inside my mind. The clamor is endless, time is meaningless. I am plunged into darkness with the noise, the noise, the noise. Before long I am howling too, scraping my broken nails into the walls. 
 
 My body lays in a nursing home bed, eyes open but not comprehending. He suffered a head injury they say. 
 
 I spiral, sobbing, into the lamentations of the lost souls around me, and forget it all.

Two infants wailed competitively. Their mothers cast accusing glares toward one another. Looming in the far corner of the room was an old Sharp television battling against the infants for attention.

 A god-damned People Magazine. 
 
 The cover was busy with random colors, slanderous words, and one of those shitty zoomed shots of an already shitty picture. I picked up the magazine and thumbed through the pages looking for anything that warranted my time. A picture of Lizzy Caplan caught my eye. She was out at night with some guy. The title said something about `` A *Friendly Night Out* with James Marsden''.

","Looking at the closed casket I realize what a dream come true this will be for me. It's the woman from last week. I almost shiver with dark memory, but I am an artist and an artist must have control. So instead I move away from the hall and into a private room. The funeral parlor is old, and I imagine I can smell the formaldehyde of a thousand embalmings seeping out of the oak paneled walls. It is a clinical and cold smell and I appreciate its aestheticism. In reality I can not smell embalming fluid, it really smells of old people, flowers, and heavy perfumes. 
 
 It is such a special day. It makes me want to play something special. I'm supposed to be part of a quartet, but I'm giddy and wound up from the sheer exuberance of that perfectly remembered night. I want to send the quartet out and simply walk among the guests, playing straight into their heart and their ear. It feels as if I am reliving the moment over and over. My teeth hurt with the sweetness of it. 
 
 Again though, I wish I could change the song. I am meant to be playing Dvorak, a melancholy lilting tune by name of `` Going Home''. It does not fit the occasion at all. This is a happy moment. For me, but especially for her. I've given her the gift of love after all. Soon the seats will fill with her well wishers, her mourners, her friends and family. They will be here to celebrate her life. They will laugh when her brothers tearfully remembers some childhood squabble they had. They will weep when her mother espouses her love. They will wail and nash their teeth when her father breaks down crying that it was `` too soon, too soon''. They will do this all for her. Some men, myself included, would do anything for our fifteen minutes as the showbiz saying goes. Ahem, I suppose I must say that I have done almost everything. I have never realized before how powerful I am. How my one act can charge the emotions of so many people. It makes me unto god and makes her into my creation.
